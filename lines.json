millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and, suspecting this, an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money."}, {"default": "Tom talked

proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.", "alpha": "The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby."}, {"default": "He was his wife’s man and not his own.", "length": "Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty—as if he had just got some poor girl with child.", "alpha": "The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the ash-heaps was the principal witness at the inquest."}, {"default": "So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson wouldn’t say a word—instead he began to throw

deliberately to the other side of the car.", "alpha": "The younger of the two was a stranger to me."}, {"default": "Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later.", "length": "With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool.", "alpha": "Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space."}, {"default": "But he didn’t.", "length": "But there was nothing—only the picture of Dan Cody, a

interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away."}, {"default": "When he came outside again, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation because he heard Mrs. Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in the garage.", "length": "I didn’t want it to be in the papers and draw a sightseeing crowd, so I’d been calling up a few people myself.", "alpha": "Then I got up…\""}, {"default": "\"Beat me!\"", "length": "When I was a young man it was different—if a friend of mine died, no matter how, I stuck

her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers."}, {"default": "\"All night, if necessary.", "length": "Then I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door.", "alpha": "This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the \"creative

service to be rendered, I had no choice except to cut him off there.", "alpha": "This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into Daisy’s heart,

bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the ground floor.", "length": "When he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes

the porch where we had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window.", "length": "As for Tom, the fact that he \"had some woman

drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.", "length": "But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel.", "alpha": "\"Three o’clock, here at the house."}, {"default": "Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table, with a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of ale.", "length": "A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril.", "alpha": "Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard somewhere a long time ago."}, {"default": "He was talking intently across the table at her,

embrace.", "alpha": "Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening-dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed."}, {"default": "Once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.", "length":

speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of misconceptions away.", "alpha": "Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighbourhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases,

rather not be the polo player,\" said Tom pleasantly, \"I’d rather look at all these famous people in—in oblivion.\"", "alpha": "Throwing open the French windows of the drawing-room, we sat smoking

me: \"If it’s light enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.\"", "alpha": "Thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for his time—there were boys who had seen a man \"acting

"\"Yes, it’s all quiet.\"", "length": "Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s \"I think he killed a man,\" and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity.", "alpha": "To my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look."}, {"default": "I hesitated.", "length": "In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust.", "alpha": "To my overwhelming surprise the living-room was deserted."}, {"default": "\"You’d better come home and get some sleep.\"", "length": "The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a greenhouse arrived from Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it.", "alpha": "To the wingless a more interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size."}, {"default": "He shook his head.", "length": "He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physically sick.", "alpha": "To young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck, that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world."}, {"default": "\"I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed.", "length": "In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car.", "alpha": "Together we scrutinized the

heart I love her all the time.\"", "alpha": "Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder."}, {"default": "He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil.", "length": "About three o’clock the quality of Wilson’s incoherent muttering changed—he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car.", "alpha": "Tom and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies."}, {"default": "So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight—watching over nothing.", "length": "There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.", "alpha": "Tom and I looked at each other blankly."}, {"default": "I couldn’t sleep all night; a foghorn was groaning incessantly on the Sound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage, frightening dreams.", "length": "There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more.", "alpha": "Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod, and they trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage just as Gatsby, with hat and light overcoat in hand, came out the front door."}, {"default": "Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby’s drive, and immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress—I felt that I had something to tell him, something to warn him about, and morning would be too late.", "length": "The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner.", "alpha": "Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the Saturday Evening Post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune."}, {"default": "Crossing his lawn, I saw that his front door was still open and he was leaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.", "length": "\"Oh, sure,\" agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went toward the little office, mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls.", "alpha": "Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front."}, {"default": "\"Nothing happened,\" he said wanly.", "length": "It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life.", "alpha": "Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together."}, {"default": "\"I waited, and about four o’clock she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out the light.\"", "length": "His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the room—he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind.", "alpha": "Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms."}, {"default": "His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes.", "length": "He waited a moment longer, hoping I’d begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went unwillingly home.", "alpha": "Tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the train."}, {"default": "We pushed aside curtains that were like pavilions, and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric light switches—once I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano.", "length": "He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years when he turned up as James Gatz’s destiny in Little Girl Bay.", "alpha": "Tom demanded."}, {"default": "There was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere, and the rooms were musty, as though they hadn’t been aired for many days.", "length": "I looked at the house; there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the ground floor.", "alpha": "Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then his foot came down hard, and the coupé raced along through the night."}, {"default": "I found the humidor on an unfamiliar table, with two stale, dry cigarettes inside.", "length": "A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden.", "alpha": "Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body, and hurried into the room."}, {"default": "Throwing open the French windows of the drawing-room, we sat smoking out into the darkness.", "length": "Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.", "alpha": "Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief."}, {"default": "\"You ought to go away,\" I said.", "length": "Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.", "alpha": "Tom laughed and turned to me."}, {"default": "\"It’s pretty certain they’ll trace your car.\"", "length": "Only wind in the trees, which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness.", "alpha": "Tom looked at him blankly."}, {"default": "\"Go away now, old sport?\"", "length": "We both looked down at the grass—there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began.", "alpha": "Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed."}, {"default": "\"Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal.\"", "length": "\"I thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon my—you see, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of side line, you understand.", "alpha": "Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves."}, {"default": "He wouldn’t consider it.", "length": "As Gatsby closed the door of \"the Merton College Library\" I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into ghostly laughter.", "alpha": "Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines."}, {"default": "He couldn’t possibly leave Daisy until he knew what she was going to do.", "length": "She turned to me, and her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: \"Do you know why we left Chicago?", "alpha": "Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but his voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamour on the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead."}, {"default": "He was clutching at some last hope and I couldn’t bear to shake him free.", "length": "Wilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.", "alpha": "Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair."}, {"default": "It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with Dan Cody—told it to me because \"Jay Gatsby\" had broken up like glass against Tom’s hard malice, and the long secret extravaganza was played out.", "length": "If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream.", "alpha": "Tom threw on both brakes impatiently, and we slid to an abrupt dusty stop under Wilson’s sign."}, {"default": "I think that he would have acknowledged anything now, without reserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.", "length": "It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found marvelling over Gatsby’s books in the library one night three months before.", "alpha": "Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on Wilson’s body."}, {"default": "She was the first \"nice\" girl he had ever known.", "length": "We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end.", "alpha": "Tom turned to Daisy sharply."}, {"default": "In various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people, but always with indiscernible barbed wire between.", "length": "Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passersby.", "alpha": "Tom turned to me."}, {"default": "He found her excitingly desirable.", "length": "You see, I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad things that happened to me.\"", "alpha": "Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby’s party."}, {"default":

"length": "An hour later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-coloured tie, hurried in.", "alpha": "Tomorrow!\""}, {"default": "But what gave it an air of breathless intensity, was that Daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him.", "length": "I went in—after making every possible noise in the kitchen, short of pushing over the stove—but I don’t believe they heard a sound.", "alpha": "Tom’s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd."}, {"default": "There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and

wiping at it with her handkerchief before a mirror.", "alpha": "\"Tom’s getting very profound,\" said Daisy, with an expression of unthoughtful sadness."}, {"default": "It excited him, too, that many

Gatsby."}, {"default": "But he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a colossal accident.", "length": "I must have felt pretty weird by that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon.", "alpha": "Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby’s drive, and immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress—I felt that I had something to tell him, something to warn him about, and morning would be too late."}, {"default": "However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the

no real right to touch her hand.", "length": "A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and shouting—before he could move from his door the business was over.", "alpha": "Turning a corner, I saw that it was Gatsby’s house, lit from tower to cellar."}, {"default": "He might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under false pretences.", "length": "There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together.", "alpha": "Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped the tide offshore."}, {"default": "I don’t mean that he had traded on his phantom millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as herself—that he was fully able to take care of her.", "length": "There was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an exclamation… then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.", "alpha": "\"Twelve minutes to my train.\""}, {"default": "As a matter of fact, he had no such facilities—he had no comfortable family standing behind him, and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world.", "length": "I saw right away he was a fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told me he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good.", "alpha": "\"Twelve years.\""}, {"default": "But he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he had imagined.", "length": "A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing, and I began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars.", "alpha": "Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound."}, {"default": "He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go—but now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail.", "length": "Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward.", "alpha": "Two hundred and sixty-five dollars.\""}, {"default": "He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn’t realize just how extraordinary a \"nice\" girl could be.", "length": "\"Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,\" he said, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more.", "alpha": "\"Two of them we have framed downstairs.\""}, {"default": "She vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing.", "length": "So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York—or not quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car.", "alpha": "Two o’clock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires."}, {"default": "He felt married to her, that was all.", "length": "… I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.", "alpha": "Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward."}, {"default": "When they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless, who was, somehow, betrayed.", "length": "Evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning.", "alpha": "\"Two studies."}, {"default": "Her porch was bright with the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth.", "length": "Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I joined the last of Gatsby’s guests, who were clustered around him.", "alpha": "\"Two what?\""}, {"default": "She had caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.", "length": "Then from the living-room I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh, followed by Daisy’s voice on a clear artificial note:", "alpha": "Under the dripping bare lilac-trees a large open car was coming up the drive."}, {"default": "\"I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her, old sport.", "length": "To young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck, that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world.", "alpha": "Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan, I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs, and so I drew up the girl beside me, tightening my arms."}, {"default": "I even hoped for a while that she’d throw me over, but she didn’t, because she was in love with me too.", "length": "He was left with his singularly appropriate education; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substantiality of a man.", "alpha": "Until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front of the garage, while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the couch inside."}, {"default": "She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her… Well, there I was, way off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn’t care.", "length": "Then they sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour, while at her request I remained watchfully in the garden.", "alpha": "Up in the city, I tried for a while to list the quotations on an interminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair."}, {"default": "What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do?\"", "length": "I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler’s voice calling a taxi.", "alpha": "Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxicabs drive away before she selected a new one, lavender-coloured with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine."}, {"default": "On the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time.", "length": "Up in the city, I tried for a while to list the quotations on an interminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair.", "alpha": "Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool, as if a divot from a green golf-links had come sailing in at the office window, but this morning it seemed harsh and dry."}, {"default": "It was a cold fall day, with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed.", "length": "\"Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,\" he seemed to say, \"just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.\"", "alpha": "Various—\""}, {"default": "Now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair.", "length": "Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away.", "alpha": "\"Very good roads around here.\""}, {"default": "The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised.", "length": "Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.", "alpha": "\"Very much.\""}, {"default": "They had never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with another, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep.", "length": "We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile.", "alpha": "\"Very romantic,\" he said, and then miserably to me: \"If it’s light enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.\""}, {"default": "He did extraordinarily well in the war.", "length": "and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man, with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blond hair.", "alpha": "\"Very well."}, {"default": "He was a captain before he went to the front, and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machine-guns.", "length": "\"Now see here, Tom,\" said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, \"if you’re going to make personal remarks I won’t stay here a minute.", "alpha": "\"Very well.\""}, {"default": "After the armistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead.", "length": "It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been made.", "alpha": "\"Wait a minute,\" I interrupted."}, {"default": "He was worried now—there was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy’s letters.", "length": "The rain poured down his thick glasses, and he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled from Gatsby’s grave.", "alpha": "\"Wait a minute,\" snapped Tom, \"I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question.\""}, {"default": "She didn’t see why he couldn’t come.", "length": "It was a few days before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.", "alpha": "\"Wake me at eight, won’t you.\""}, {"default": "She was feeling the pressure of the world outside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.", "length": "A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: \"There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and the tired.\"", "alpha": "\"Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth.\""}, {"default": "For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes.", "length": "About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one morning at Gatsby’s door and asked him if he had anything to say.", "alpha": "\"Want any of this stuff?"}, {"default": "All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the \"Beale Street Blues\" while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust.", "length": "Thirty—the promise of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning briefcase of enthusiasm, thinning hair.", "alpha": "\"Want any?\""}, {"default": "At the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low, sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor.", "length": "There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other.", "alpha": "\"Want to go with me, old sport?"}, {"default": "Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening-dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed.", "length": "It was Gatsby’s father, a solemn old man, very helpless and dismayed, bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day.", "alpha": "\"Was Daisy driving?\""}, {"default": "And all the time something within her was crying for a decision.", "length": "Some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall; when I told them who had arrived, they went reluctantly away.", "alpha": "\"Was she killed?\""}, {"default": "She wanted her life shaped now, immediately—and the decision must be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality—that was close at hand.", "length": "(I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)", "alpha": "Watching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat."}, {"default": "That force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom Buchanan.", "length": "It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again.", "alpha": "We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile."}, {"default": "There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position, and Daisy was flattered.", "length": "I am, and you are, and you are, and—\" After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again.", "alpha": "We all looked—the knuckle was black and blue."}, {"default": "Doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief.", "length": "You can’t stop going with an old friend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumoured into marriage.", "alpha": "We all turned and looked around for Gatsby."}, {"default": "The letter reached Gatsby while he was still at Oxford.", "length": "I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and profound.", "alpha": "We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller."}, {"default": "It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey-turning, gold-turning light.", "length": "Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano.", "alpha": "We both jumped up, and, a little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard."}, {"default": "The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves.", "length": "I was sure the request would be something utterly fantastic, and for a moment I was sorry I’d ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn.", "alpha": "We both looked down at the grass—there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began."}, {"default": "There was a slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool, lovely day.", "length": "We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the façade of Fifty-Ninth Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park.", "alpha": "\"We can’t argue about it here,\" Tom said impatiently, as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us."}, {"default": "\"I don’t think she ever loved him.\"", "length": "While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little now and then with gusts of emotion.", "alpha": "\"We can’t move,\" they said together."}, {"default": "Gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly.", "length": "Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out—an unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.", "alpha": "\"We could go to any of the universities in England or France.\""}, {"default": "\"You must remember, old sport, she was very excited this afternoon.", "length": "Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight.", "alpha": "\"We don’t go around very much,\" he said; \"in fact, I was just thinking I don’t know a soul here.\""}, {"default": "He told her those things in a way that frightened her—that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper.", "length": "A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but the silence was unbroken by his \"thank you\" and the soft closing of the door.", "alpha": "\"We don’t know each other very well, Nick,\" she said suddenly."}, {"default": "And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.\"", "length": "He was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and realized that dawn wasn’t far off.", "alpha": "We drank in long, greedy swallows."}, {"default": "He sat down gloomily.", "length": "I drove from the station directly to Gatsby’s house and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed anyone.", "alpha": "We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour, before we melted indistinguishably into it again."}, {"default": "\"Of course she might have loved him just for a minute, when they were first married—and loved me more even then, do you see?\"", "length": "So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to come back home.", "alpha": "We drove over to Fifth Avenue, warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the summer Sunday afternoon."}, {"default": "Suddenly he came out with a curious remark.", "length": "All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath, and there’s a persistent wail all night along the north shore.\"", "alpha": "We gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and half an hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over."}, {"default": "\"In any case,\" he said, \"it was just personal.\"", "length": "They were at least agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key.", "alpha": "We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy."}, {"default": "What could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that couldn’t be measured?", "length": "And with this doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces, and I wondered if there wasn’t something a little sinister about him, after all.", "alpha": "We had an awful time getting back, I can tell you."}, {"default": "He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville on the last of his army pay.", "length": "Next day at five o’clock she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a three months’ trip to the South Seas.", "alpha": "We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale."}, {"default": "He stayed there a week, walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which they had driven in her white car.", "length": "Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom.", "alpha": "We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started, but we got gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms."}, {"default": "Just as Daisy’s house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses, so his idea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded with a melancholy beauty.", "length": "They arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds, Daisy’s voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.", "alpha": "We hadn’t reached West Egg village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-coloured suit."}, {"default": "He left feeling that if he had searched harder, he might have found her—that he was leaving her behind.", "length": "Tom and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.", "alpha": "\"We haven’t met for many years,\" said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be."}, {"default": "The day-coach—he was penniless now—was hot.", "length": "The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, \"Excuse me\"—but this time no one laughed.", "alpha": "\"We heard it from three people, so it must be true.\""}, {"default": "He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by.", "length": "Wilson was quieter now, and Michaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage, Wilson was gone.", "alpha": "\"We heard that you were engaged.\""}, {"default": "Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.", "length": "I helped him to a bedroom upstairs; while he took off his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been deferred until he came.", "alpha": "We heard you were engaged to a girl out West.\""}, {"default": "The track curved and now it was going away from the sun, which, as it sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city where she had drawn her breath.", "length": "A white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity—except his wife, who moved close to Tom.", "alpha": "\"We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: ‘There’s somebody that needs your help, Doc.’ \""}, {"default": "He stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him.", "length": "Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her.", "alpha": "\"We ought to plan something,\" yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed."}, {"default": "But it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it, the freshest and the best, forever.", "length": "The girl who was with him got into the papers, too, because her arm was broken—she was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.", "alpha": "We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of red-belted oceangoing ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded-gilt nineteen-hundreds."}, {"default": "It was nine o’clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the porch.", "length": "Once more it was pouring, and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsby’s gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes.", "alpha": "We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the façade of Fifty-Ninth Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park."}, {"default": "The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there was an autumn flavour in the air.", "length": "The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west, and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.", "alpha": "We pushed aside curtains that were like pavilions, and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric light switches—once I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano."}, {"default": "The gardener, the last one of Gatsby’s former servants, came to the foot of the steps.", "length": "Sometimes in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone.", "alpha": "We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away."}, {"default": "\"I’m going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby.", "length": "As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon.", "alpha": "We shook hands and I started away."}, {"default": "Leaves’ll start falling pretty soon, and then there’s always trouble with the pipes.\"", "length": "\"I’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,\" Tom was saying to Gatsby, \"but I’m the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.\"", "alpha": "We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors."}, {"default": "\"Don’t do it today,\" Gatsby answered.", "length": "Crossing his lawn, I saw that his front door was still open and he was leaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.", "alpha": "We shook hands."}, {"default": "He turned to me apologetically.", "length": "He stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him.", "alpha": "We slowed down."}, {"default": "\"You know, old sport, I’ve never used that pool all summer?\"", "length": "Then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women’s voices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of pain.", "alpha": "We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead."}, {"default": "I looked at my watch and stood up.", "length": "One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song.", "alpha": "We straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars."}, {"default": "\"Twelve minutes to my train.\"", "length": "When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park.", "alpha": "We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch."}, {"default": "I didn’t want to go to the city.", "length": "Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.", "alpha": "We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France."}, {"default": "I wasn’t worth a decent stroke of work, but it was more than that—I didn’t want to leave Gatsby.", "length": "The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of \"Yea—ea—ea!\"", "alpha": "We talked like that for a while, and then abruptly we weren’t talking any longer."}, {"default": "I missed that train, and then another, before I could get myself away.", "length": "But it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it, the freshest and the best, forever.", "alpha": "We waited for her down the road and out of sight."}, {"default": "\"I’ll call you up,\" I said finally.", "length": "He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him to pump it up.", "alpha": "We walked slowly down the steps."}, {"default": "\"Do, old sport.\"", "length": "As we started through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground.", "alpha": "We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end."}, {"default": "\"I’ll call you about noon.\"", "length": "\"He came to the door while we were getting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we weren’t in he tried to force his way upstairs.", "alpha": "We went by way of Marseilles."}, {"default": "We walked slowly down the steps.", "length": "Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighbourhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases, and went haughtily in.", "alpha": "We went in."}, {"default": "\"I suppose Daisy’ll call too.\"", "length": "Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.", "alpha": "We went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds."}, {"default": "He looked at me anxiously, as if he hoped I’d corroborate this.", "length": "The bottle of whisky—a second one—was now in constant demand by all present, excepting Catherine, who \"felt just as good on nothing at all.\"", "alpha": "We went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms, and bathrooms with sunken baths—intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor."}, {"default": "\"I suppose so.\"", "length": "He smiled—and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired it all the time.", "alpha": "We were all irritable now with the fading ale, and aware of it we drove for a while in silence."}, {"default": "\"Well, goodbye.\"", "length": "I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gave me a decoration—even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea!\"", "alpha": "We were always thanking him for that—I and the others."}, {"default": "We shook hands and I started away.", "length": "So I don’t know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Island, or for how many hours he \"glanced into rooms\" while his house blazed gaudily on.", "alpha": "We were at a particularly tipsy table."}, {"default": "Just before I reached the hedge I remembered something and turned around.", "length": "Gatsby got himself into a shadow and, while Daisy and I talked, looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense, unhappy eyes.", "alpha": "\"We were close friends.\""}, {"default": "\"They’re a rotten crowd,\" I shouted across the lawn.", "length": "A massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker’s defence:", "alpha": "We were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own."}, {"default": "\"You’re worth the whole damn bunch put together.\"", "length": "\"She’s much obliged, I’m sure,\" said another friend, without gratitude, \"but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool.\"", "alpha": "We were silent."}, {"default": "I’ve always been glad I said that.", "length": "Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.", "alpha": "We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl, who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter."}, {"default": "It was the only compliment I ever gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end.", "length": "He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by.", "alpha": "We were so thick like that in everything\"—he held up two bulbous fingers—\"always together.\""}, {"default": "First he nodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding smile, as if we’d been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time.", "length": "At two o’clock Gatsby put on his bathing-suit and left word with the butler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool.", "alpha": "\"We won’t be late if we start now,\" she insisted aloud."}, {"default": "His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of colour against the white steps, and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral home, three months before.", "length": "I went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that they were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it.", "alpha": "Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passersby."}, {"default": "The lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruption—and he had stood on those steps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye.", "length": "Dimly I heard someone murmur \"Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,\" and then the owl-eyed man said \"Amen to that,\" in a brave voice.", "alpha": "\"Well!\""}, {"default": "I thanked him for his hospitality.", "length": "The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear, whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside.", "alpha": "\"Well, I liked him anyhow.\""}, {"default": "We were always thanking him for that—I and the others.", "length": "Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room.", "alpha": "\"Well, I married him,\" said Myrtle, ambiguously."},

sheepishly."}, {"default": "She must have broken her rule against drinking that night, for when she arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had already gone to

stare.", "alpha": "Were you a friend of my boy’s, Mr.—?\""}, {"default": "Finally someone said it was a shame, and closed the door.", "length": "Sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby

possessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real.", "alpha": "We’ll follow you in the coupé.\""}, {"default": "He announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen.", "length": "He talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy.", "alpha": "\"We’ll go downstairs,\" interrupted Gatsby."},

enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon.", "alpha": "\"We’ll meet you on some corner."}, {"default": "Michaelis made a clumsy attempt to distract him.", "length": "Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at the table.", "alpha": "We’ll ride around and meet you after.\""}, {"default": "\"How long have you been married, George?", "length": "Involuntarily I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away,

arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with ferocious delicacy.", "alpha": "\"We’re getting old,\" said Daisy."}, {"default": "Come on, George, sit still—I asked you a question.", "length": "It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died.", "alpha": "\"We’re getting sickantired of it."}, {"default": "Did you ever have any children?\"", "length": "He was a captain before he went to the front, and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machine-guns.", "alpha": "\"We’ve come straight from New York,\" I said."}, {"default": "The hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light, and whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like the car that hadn’t stopped a few hours before.", "length": "On the other hand, no garage man who had seen him ever came forward, and perhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to know.", "alpha": "\"We’ve got enough to get us to town,\" said Tom."}, {"default": "He didn’t like to go into the garage, because the work bench was stained where the body had been lying, so he moved uncomfortably around the office—he knew every object in it before morning—and from time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet.", "length": "On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer, I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more.", "alpha": "\"We’ve got to beat them down,\" whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun."}, {"default": "\"Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George?", "length": "He didn’t say any more, but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that.", "alpha": "We’ve got to go.\""}, {"default": "Maybe even if you haven’t been there for a long time?", "length": "It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such intentions in her head.", "alpha": "\"We’ve met before,\" muttered Gatsby."}, {"default": "Maybe I could call up the church and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?\"", "length": "He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf, muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse.", "alpha": "\"What Gatsby?\""}, {"default": "\"Don’t belong to any.\"", "length": "It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm around Jordan’s golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to dinner.", "alpha": "What I called up about is—\""}, {"default": "\"You ought to have a church, George, for times like this.", "length": "Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away.", "alpha": "\"What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there."}, {"default": "You must have gone to church once.", "length": "Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his grasping cries:", "alpha": "\"What I say is, why go on living with them if they can’t stand them?"}, {"default": "Didn’t you get married in a church?", "length": "He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil.", "alpha": "\"What a low, vulgar girl!\""}, {"default": "Listen, George, listen to me.", "length": "From the moment I telephoned news of the catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every practical question, was referred to me.", "alpha": "\"What about it?\""}, {"default": "Didn’t you get married in a church?\"", "length": "All my aunts and

long time ago.\"", "length": "They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house.", "alpha": "What could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that couldn’t be measured?"}, {"default": "The effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking—for a moment he was silent.", "length": "When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned towards me.", "alpha": "\"What day would suit you?\""}, {"default": "Then the same half-knowing, half-bewildered look came back into his faded eyes.", "length": "But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J.

inexperience I believed they didn’t—drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound.", "alpha": "\"What do I owe you?\""}, {"default": "\"Which drawer?\"", "length": "The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs.", "alpha": "\"What do I owe you?\""}, {"default": "\"That drawer—that one.\"", "length": "After that, if the night was mellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel, and over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station.", "alpha": "What do you expect?\""}, {"default": "Michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand.", "length": "I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a tray.", "alpha": "\"What do you say?\""}, {"default": "There was nothing in it but a small, expensive dog-leash, made of leather and braided silver.", "length": "… Through the hall of the Buchanans’ house blew a faint wind, carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at the door.", "alpha": "\"What do you think of that?"},

filling the house with grey-turning, gold-turning light.", "alpha": "\"What do you think?\""}, {"default": "he inquired, holding it up.", "length": "When the butler brought back Wolfshiem’s answer I began to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me against them all.", "alpha": "\"What do you want money for, all of a sudden?\""}, {"default": "Wilson stared and nodded.", "length": "\"Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,\" he told me, \"just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.\"", "alpha": "What d’you

provocation to uncontrollable laughter.", "alpha": "\"What grass?\""}, {"default": "She tried to tell me about it, but I knew it was something funny.\"", "length": "On the contrary, they were merely casual events in a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs.", "alpha": "\"What happened?—that’s what I want to know.\""}, {"default": "\"You mean your wife bought it?\"", "length": "With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire, and disappeared into the living-room.",

Gatsby’s enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church steeple, for half an hour.", "alpha": "\"What if I did tell him?"}, {"default": "Michaelis didn’t see anything odd in that, and he gave Wilson a dozen reasons why his wife might have bought the dog-leash.", "length": "So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.", "alpha": "\"What is?\""}, {"default": "But conceivably Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle, because he began saying \"Oh, my God!\"", "length": "Crossing the porch where we had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window.", "alpha": "\"What kind are

out to the ash-heaps, where small grey clouds took on fantastic shapes and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind.", "alpha": "\"What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house

into formality as several people approached him to say goodbye.", "alpha": "\"What place is that?\""}, {"default": "\"I have a way of finding out.\"", "length": "In the ditch beside the road, right side up, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupé which had left Gatsby’s drive not two minutes before.", "alpha": "What realism!"}, {"default": "\"You’re morbid, George,\" said his friend.", "length": "\"I’m going to make a big request of you today,\" he said, pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction, \"so I thought you ought to know something about me.", "alpha": "What

Tom.", "alpha": "\"What’s the matter, Daisy?\""}, {"default": "\"I spoke to her,\" he muttered, after a long silence.", "length": "\"Well, the fact is—the truth of the matter is that I’m staying with

four years—even after I’d met him on Long Island I didn’t realize it was the same man.", "alpha": "When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart."}, {"default": "But Wilson stood there a long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight.", "length": "First he nodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding smile, as if we’d been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time.", "alpha": "When I came back they had both disappeared, so I sat down discreetly in the living-room and read a chapter of Simon Called Peter—either it was terrible stuff or the whisky distorted things, because it didn’t make any sense to me."}, {"default": "By six o’clock Michaelis was worn out, and grateful for the sound of a car stopping outside.", "length": "Until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front of the garage, while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the couch inside.", "alpha": "When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a

came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the kerb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before."}, {"default": "Wilson was quieter now, and Michaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage, Wilson was gone.", "length": "Snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett’s automobile ran over his right hand.", "alpha": "When I had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man."}, {"default": "His movements—he was on foot all the time—were afterward traced to Port Roosevelt and then to Gad’s Hill, where he bought a sandwich that he didn’t eat, and a cup of coffee.", "length": "Then the valley

husky, rhythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again.", "alpha": "When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness."}, {"default": "Thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for his time—there were boys who had seen a man \"acting sort of crazy,\" and motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road.", "length": "And yet I couldn’t believe that they would choose this occasion for a scene—especially for the rather harrowing scene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden.", "alpha": "When I passed the ash-heaps on the train that morning I had crossed deliberately to the other side of the car."}, {"default": "Then for three hours he disappeared from view.",

were a particular friend of Tom’s, he started to abandon the whole idea."}, {"default": "The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he \"had a way of finding out,\" supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabout, inquiring for a yellow car.", "length": "I couldn’t sleep all night; a foghorn was groaning incessantly on the Sound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage, frightening dreams.", "alpha": "When I say he’s in Chicago, he’s in Chicago.\""}, {"default": "On the other hand, no garage man who had seen him ever came forward, and perhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to know.", "length": "The door that I pushed open, on the advice of an elevator boy, was marked \"The Swastika Holding Company,\" and at first there didn’t seem to be anyone inside.", "alpha": "When I was a young man it was different—if a friend of mine died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end."}, {"default": "By half-past two he was in West Egg, where he asked someone the way to Gatsby’s house.", "length": "I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging sky and a lustreless moon.", "alpha": "When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address—inside of a week I got a package from Croirier’s with a new evening gown in it.\""}, {"default": "So by that time he knew Gatsby’s name.", "length": "The fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder, and then the man—it was the late patron of Gatsby’s library.", "alpha": "When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park."}, {"default": "At two o’clock Gatsby put on his bathing-suit and left word with the butler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool.", "length": "The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.", "alpha": "When Klipspringer had played \"The Love Nest\" he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom."}, {"default": "He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him to pump it up.", "length": "He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths—so that he could \"come over\" some afternoon to a stranger’s garden.", "alpha": "When Michaelis’s testimony at the inquest brought to light Wilson’s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade—but Catherine, who might have said anything, didn’t say a word."}, {"default": "Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn’t to be taken out under any circumstances—and this was strange, because the front right fender needed repair.", "length": "A maid began opening the upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from the large central bay, spat meditatively into the garden.", "alpha": "\"When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way."}, {"default": "Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool.", "length": "He hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes.", "alpha": "When anyone spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable, colourless way."}, {"default": "Once he stopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he needed help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among the yellowing trees.", "length": "He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God.", "alpha": "\"When are you going to sell me that car?\""}, {"default": "No telephone message arrived, but the butler went without his sleep and waited for it until four o’clock—until long after there was anyone to give it to if it came.", "length": "Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn’t to be taken out under any circumstances—and this was strange, because the front right fender needed repair.", "alpha": "When he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes were bright and tired."}, {"default": "I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn’t believe it would come, and perhaps he no longer cared.", "length": "His acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular cafés with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with whomsoever he knew.", "alpha": "When he came outside again, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation because he heard Mrs. Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in the garage."}, {"default": "If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream.", "length": "A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and went off into a deep vinous sleep.", "alpha": "When he had gone halfway he turned around and stared at the scene—his wife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and the despairing figure on the couch, bleeding fluently, and trying to spread a copy of Town Tattle over the tapestry scenes of Versailles."}, {"default": "He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass.", "length": "Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.", "alpha": "When he realized what I was talking about, that there were twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man, like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to Daisy."}, {"default": "A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about… like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees.", "length": "All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the \"Beale Street Blues\" while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust.", "alpha": "When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction."}, {"default": "The chauffeur—he was one of Wolfshiem’s protégés—heard the shots—afterwards he could only say that he hadn’t thought anything much about them.", "length": "At nine o’clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby’s gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its three-noted horn.", "alpha": "When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue eyes."}, {"default": "I drove from the station directly to Gatsby’s house and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed anyone.", "length": "Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he stared at it for a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky.", "alpha": "When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—constrained to assure her of my surprise."}, {"default": "But they knew then, I firmly believe.", "length": "On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages alongshore, the world and its mistress returned to Gatsby’s house and twinkled hilariously on his lawn.", "alpha": "When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside."}, {"default": "With scarcely a word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener, and I hurried down to the pool.", "length": "Then he drifted back to Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day that Dan Cody’s yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore.", "alpha": "When she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms."}, {"default": "There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other.", "length": "\"I’ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you’re waiting you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supper—if you want any.\"", "alpha": "When she’s had five or six cocktails she always starts screaming like that."}, {"default": "With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool.", "length": "She wanted her life shaped now, immediately—and the decision must be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality—that was close at hand.", "alpha": "When the \"Jazz History of the World\" was over, girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men’s arms, even into groups, knowing that someone would arrest their falls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby, and no French bob touched Gatsby’s shoulder, and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s head for one link."}, {"default": "A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden.", "length": "If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.", "alpha": "When the butler brought back Wolfshiem’s answer I began to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me against them all."}, {"default": "The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red circle in the water.", "length": "She took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up in a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the soap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.", "alpha": "When the melody rose her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air."}, {"default": "It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener saw Wilson’s body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was complete.", "length": "Instead of being the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bond business.", "alpha": "When the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was calling I thought this would be Daisy at last."}, {"default": "After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the next day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and newspaper men in and out of Gatsby’s front door.", "length": "My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season.", "alpha": "When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet."}, {"default": "A rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard, and there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the pool.", "length": "At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round.", "alpha": "When they convinced her of this, she immediately fainted, as if that was the intolerable part of the affair."}, {"default": "Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the expression \"madman\" as he bent over Wilson’s body that afternoon, and the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning.", "length": "He took what he could get, ravenously and unscrupulously—eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took her because he had no real right to touch her hand.", "alpha": "\"When they do get married,\" continued Catherine, \"they’re going West to live for a while until it blows over.\""}, {"default": "Most of those reports were a nightmare—grotesque, circumstantial, eager, and untrue.", "length": "Just as Tom and Myrtle (after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called each other by our first names) reappeared, company commenced to arrive at the apartment door.", "alpha": "When they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless, who was, somehow, betrayed."}, {"default": "When Michaelis’s testimony at the inquest brought to light Wilson’s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade—but Catherine, who might have said anything, didn’t say a word.", "length": "The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the Mediterranean—then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me back into the room.", "alpha": "When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand."}, {"default": "She showed a surprising amount of character about it too—looked at the coroner with determined eyes under that corrected brow of hers, and swore that her sister had never seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her sister had been into no mischief whatever.", "length": "When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address—inside of a week I got a package from Croirier’s with a new evening gown in it.\"", "alpha": "When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white shirtfront pressed against my arm, and so I told him I’d have to call a policeman, but he knew I lied."}, {"default": "She convinced herself of it, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the very suggestion was more than she could endure.", "length": "From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O. R. P. Schraeders, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells.", "alpha": "When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air."}, {"default": "So Wilson was reduced to a man \"deranged by grief\" in order that the case might remain in its simplest form.", "length": "The Dancies came, too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice A. Flink, and the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer, and Beluga’s girls.", "alpha": "When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about it—and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at Daisy’s."}, {"default": "And it rested there.", "length": "There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the bureau—Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly—taken apparently when he was about eighteen.", "alpha": "When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned towards me."}, {"default": "But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential.", "length": "Each of us said over and over that it was a \"crazy idea\"—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny…", "alpha": "\"Whenever he sees I’m having a good time he wants to go home.\""}, {"default": "I found myself on Gatsby’s side, and alone.", "length": "Once he stopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he needed help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among the yellowing trees.", "alpha": "Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano."}, {"default": "From the moment I telephoned news of the catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every practical question, was referred to me.", "length": "No telephone message arrived, but the butler went without his sleep and waited for it until four o’clock—until long after there was anyone to give it to if it came.", "alpha": "\"Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,\" he told me, \"just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.\""}, {"default": "At first I was surprised and confused; then, as he lay in his house and didn’t move or breathe or speak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was responsible, because no one else was interested—interested, I mean, with that intense personal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end.", "length": "The butler gave me his office address on Broadway, and I called Information, but by the time I had the number it was long after five, and no one answered the phone.", "alpha": "\"Where are we going?\""}, {"default": "I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her instinctively and without hesitation.", "length": "In consequence, I’m inclined to reserve all judgements, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores.", "alpha": "\"Where are you going?\""}, {"default": "But she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.", "length": "It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land.", "alpha": "Where have they got Jimmy?\""}, {"default": "\"Left no address?\"", "length": "Sitting on Tom’s lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the telephone; then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some at the drugstore on the corner.", "alpha": "\"Where is he from, I mean?"},

men in town, who couldn’t get into the army at all.", "alpha": "Whereupon everybody laughed."}, {"default": "\"No.\"", "length": "Two o’clock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires.", "alpha": "\"Where’d you hear that?\""}, {"default": "\"Any idea where they are?", "length": "The

voices pitches a key higher.", "alpha": "Where’d you pick that up?\""}, {"default": "\"I don’t know.", "length": "Again at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined five deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a sinking in my heart.", "alpha": "\"Where’s Daddy?\""}, {"default": "Can’t say.\"", "length": "But I am slow-thinking and full of interior

overhead."}, {"default": "Don’t worry.", "length": "So engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly

was crazy enough to kill me if I hadn’t told him who owned the car.", "length": "It was James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas

me a quality of distortion.", "alpha": "she asked innocently."}, {"default": "He ran over Myrtle like you’d run over a dog and never even stopped his car.\"", "length": "I have forgotten their

interested and a little deaf, I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front.", "alpha": "she complained; \"I hurt it.\""}, {"default": "\"And if you think I didn’t have my share of suffering—look here, when I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby.", "length": "The silhouette of

Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her sister had been into no mischief whatever.", "alpha": "she cried."}, {"default": "They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they
