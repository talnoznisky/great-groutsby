her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers.", "length": "“And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?” I inquired.", "alpha": "I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York."}, {"default": "The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a greenhouse arrived from

me what kind of car it was!", "alpha": "“If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it.”"}, {"default": "“Oh, the grass in the yard.” He looked out the window at it,

were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.", "alpha": "It was one of the watchers of the night before who had promised to come back, so he cooked breakfast for three, which he and the other man ate together."}, {"default": "After the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and the hydroplane, and the midsummer flowers—but outside Gatsby’s window it began to rain again, so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of the Sound.", "length": "Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now.”", "alpha": "It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life."}, {"default": "“If it wasn’t for the mist we could see your home across the bay,” said Gatsby.", "length": "So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.", "alpha": "It was seven o’clock when we got into the coupé with him and started for Long Island."}, {"default": "“You always have a green light

distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her.", "length": "“Look here, old sport, you’ve got to get somebody for me.", "alpha": "It was taken in Trinity Quad—the man on my left is now the Earl of Doncaster.”"}, {"default": "It had seemed as close as a star to the moon.", "length": "“What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there.",

house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season."}, {"default": "He wanted nothing less

nice place here,” he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly.", "alpha": "“Nevertheless you did throw me over,” said Jordan suddenly."}, {"default": "Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the

up to his own.", "length": "If I was them I’d get a divorce and get married to each other right away.”", "alpha": "Next day Gatsby called me on the phone."}, {"default": "He knew that when he kissed

door.”"}, {"default": "Then he kissed her.", "length": "Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop.", "alpha": "Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter

book."}, {"default": "Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard somewhere a long time ago.", "length": "Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together.", "alpha": "“Next week; I’ve got my man working on it now.”"}, {"default": "For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man’s, as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air.", "length": "“I got dressed before luncheon,” said the child,

big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,” suggested Jordan.", "length": "I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later I got up to go home.", "alpha": "She snapped them out with her fingers."}, {"default": "“I love New York on summer afternoons when everyone’s away.", "length": "“I’ll tell you God’s truth.” His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by.", "alpha": "She stood it pretty well.”"}, {"default": "There’s something very sensuous about it—overripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.”", "length": "It was a great relief, and I tried very hard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life.", "alpha": "She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her… Well, there I was, way off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn’t care."}, {"default": "The word “sensuous” had the effect of further disquieting Tom, but before he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop, and Daisy signalled us to draw up alongside.", "length": "—I was walking along from one place to another, half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns.", "alpha": "She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept."}, {"default": "“Where are we going?” she cried.", "length": "When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire.", "alpha": "She told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven times since they had been married."}, {"default": "“How about the movies?”", "length": "And I thought that if you don’t make very much—You’re selling bonds, aren’t you, old sport?”", "alpha": "She took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up and down her hips."}, {"default": "“It’s so hot,” she complained.", "length": "His eyes glanced momentarily at me, and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh.", "alpha": "She took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up in a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the soap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow."}, {"default": "“You go.", "length": "After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her presence.", "alpha": "She tried to tell me about it, but I knew it was something funny.”"}, {"default": "We’ll ride around and meet you after.” With an effort her wit rose faintly.", "length": "I suppose he smiled at Cody—he had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled.", "alpha": "She turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the front door."}, {"default": "“We’ll meet you on some corner.", "length": "“It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the armistice,” he continued.", "alpha": "She turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial laughter."}, {"default": "I’ll be the man smoking two cigarettes.”", "length": "“You’re one of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem—that much I happen to know.", "alpha": "She turned to her companion: “Wasn’t it for you, Lucille?”"}, {"default": "“We can’t argue about it here,” Tom said impatiently, as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us.", "length": "Just before noon the phone woke me, and I started up with sweat breaking out on my forehead.", "alpha": "She turned to her husband."}, {"default": "“You follow me to the south side of Central Park, in front of the Plaza.”", "length": "By six o’clock Michaelis was worn out, and grateful for the sound of a car stopping outside.", "alpha": "She turned to me, and her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: “Do you know why we left Chicago?"}, {"default": "Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight.", "length": "Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us.", "alpha": "“She used to be able to understand."}, {"default": "I think he was afraid they would dart down a side-street and out of his life forever.", "length": "The only picture was an over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock.", "alpha": "She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight."}, {"default": "But they didn’t.", "length": "Laughter is easier minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word.", "alpha": "She vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing."}, {"default": "And we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlour of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.", "length": "His voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still haunted him.", "alpha": "She vanished."}, {"default": "The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back.", "length": "Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at all—and yet there’s something in that voice of hers…", "alpha": "She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand."}, {"default": "The notion originated with Daisy’s suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as “a place to have a mint julep.” Each of us said over and over that it was a “crazy idea”—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny…", "length": "“We haven’t met for many years,” said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be.", "alpha": "She wanted her life shaped now, immediately—and the decision must be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality—that was close at hand."}, {"default": "The room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four o’clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park.", "length": "I disliked him so much by this time that I didn’t find it necessary to tell him he was wrong.", "alpha": "She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet."}, {"default": "Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us, fixing her hair.", "length": "Someone, kind or curious, took her in his car and drove her in the wake of her sister’s body.", "alpha": "She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented “place” that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village—appalled by its raw vigour that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a shortcut from nothing to nothing."}, {"default": "“It’s a swell suite,” whispered Jordan respectfully, and everyone laughed.", "length": "There was nothing in it but a small, expensive dog-leash, made of leather and braided silver.", "alpha": "She was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked like a good illustration, her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair the colour of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee."}, {"default": "“Open another window,” commanded Daisy, without turning around.", "length": "Of course we was broke up when he run off from home, but I see now there was a reason for it.", "alpha": "She was effectually prevented, but she wasn’t on speaking terms with her family for several weeks."}, {"default": "“There aren’t any more.”", "length": "Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it could support one more single man.", "alpha": "She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall."}, {"default": "“Well, we’d better telephone for an axe—”", "length": "His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed.", "alpha": "She was feeling the pressure of the world outside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all."}, {"default": "“The thing to do is to forget about the heat,” said Tom impatiently.", "length": "In a basket swung from his neck cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed.", "alpha": "She was in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her flesh sensuously as some women can."}, {"default": "“You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.”", "length": "We drove over to Fifth Avenue, warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the summer Sunday afternoon.", "alpha": "She was incurably dishonest."}, {"default": "He unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on the table.", "length": "I’ve been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.”", "alpha": "She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville."}, {"default": "“Why not let her alone, old sport?” remarked Gatsby.", "length": "The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives.", "alpha": "She was only extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words."}, {"default": "“You’re the one that wanted to come to town.”", "length": "Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders, he remarked in a determined voice:", "alpha": "She was the first “nice” girl he had ever known."}, {"default": "There was a moment of silence.", "length": "I rushed out and found her mother’s maid, and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath.", "alpha": "She wasn’t able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this unwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body."}, {"default": "The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, “Excuse me”—but this time no one laughed.", "length": "“I’m glad, Jay.” Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only of her unexpected joy.", "alpha": "She went with a slightly older crowd—when she went with anyone at all."}, {"default": "“I’ll pick it up,” I offered.", "length": "I was startled, naturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadn’t happened before.", "alpha": "She wouldn’t let go of the letter."}, {"default": "“I’ve got it.” Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered “Hum!” in an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.", "length": "Tom threw on both brakes impatiently, and we slid to an abrupt dusty stop under Wilson’s sign.", "alpha": "“She’ll be all right tomorrow,” he said presently."}, {"default": "“That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t it?” said Tom sharply.", "length": "Someone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and the policeman turned away.", "alpha": "“She’ll give you a letter of introduction, won’t you, Myrtle?”"}, {"default": "“What is?”", "length": "It excited him, too, that many men had already loved Daisy—it increased her value in his eyes.", "alpha": "“She’ll see.”"}, {"default": "“All this ‘old sport’ business.", "length": "There was a slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool, lovely day.", "alpha": "She’s a Catholic, and they don’t believe in divorce.”"}, {"default": "Where’d you pick that up?”", "length": "“I suppose Daisy’ll call too.” He looked at me anxiously, as if he hoped I’d corroborate this.", "alpha": "“She’s a deep one,” said Wilson, as if that answered the question."}, {"default": "“Now see here, Tom,” said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, “if you’re going to make personal remarks I won’t stay here a minute.", "length": "Maybe I could call up the church and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?”", "alpha": "“She’s a nice girl,” said Tom after a moment."}, {"default": "Call up and order some ice for the mint julep.”", "length": "That’s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen of a—”", "alpha": "“She’s all excited now—”"}, {"default": "As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn’s Wedding March from the ballroom below.", "length": "Then she wet her lips, and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:", "alpha": "“She’s asleep."}, {"default": "“Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!” cried Jordan dismally.", "length": "“I was able to do the commissioner a favour once, and he sends me a Christmas card every year.”", "alpha": "“She’s been talking about it for ten years.” He rested for a moment against the pump, shading his eyes."}, {"default": "“Still—I was married in the middle of June,” Daisy remembered.", "length": "Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily.", "alpha": "“She’s embarrassed?” he repeated incredulously."}, {"default": "“Louisville in June!", "length": "The arrangement lasted five years, during which the boat went three times around the Continent.", "alpha": "She’s going to spend lots of weekends out here this summer."}, {"default": "Somebody fainted.", "length": "He set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to take our stiff straw hats.", "alpha": "“She’s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow, and then we’re going to move away.”"}, {"default": "Who was it fainted, Tom?”", "length": "On the green Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea.", "alpha": "“She’s got an indiscreet voice,” I remarked."}, {"default": "“Biloxi,” he answered shortly.", "length": "We were all irritable now with the fading ale, and aware of it we drove for a while in silence.", "alpha": "She’s got my hair and shape of the face.”"}, {"default": "“A man named Biloxi.", "length": "“But I need money pretty bad, and I was wondering what you were going to do with your old car.”", "alpha": "She’s locked herself into her room, and if he tries any brutality she’s going to turn the light out and on again.”"}, {"default": "‘Blocks’ Biloxi, and he made boxes—that’s a fact—and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.”", "length": "And we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlour of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.", "alpha": "“She’s lovely,” said Daisy."}, {"default": "“They carried him into my house,” appended Jordan, “because we lived just two doors from the church.", "length": "From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air.", "alpha": "“She’s much obliged, I’m sure,” said another friend, without gratitude, “but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool.”"}, {"default": "And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy told him he had to get out.", "length": "It was the only compliment I ever gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end.", "alpha": "“She’s never loved you."}, {"default": "The day after he left Daddy died.” After a moment she added.", "length": "Michaelis and several other men were with him; first, four or five men, later two or three men.", "alpha": "“She’s not leaving me!” Tom’s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby."}, {"default": "“There wasn’t any connection.”",

Memphis,” I remarked.", "length": "It said only that the sender was leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came.", "alpha": "She’s said to be very beautiful by people who ought to know.”"}, {"default": "“That was his cousin.", "length": "Or, rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name.", "alpha": "She’s three years old."}, {"default": "I knew his whole family history before he left.", "length": "“The piece is known,” he concluded lustily, “as ‘Vladmir Tostoff’s Jazz History of the World!’ ”", "alpha": "She’s—”"}, {"default": "He gave me an aluminium putter that I use today.”", "length": "Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply—I was casually sorry, and then I forgot.", "alpha": "Silence for a moment."}, {"default": "The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of “Yea—ea—ea!” and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.", "length": "He came only once, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the garden.", "alpha": "Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall telephone."}, {"default": "“We’re getting old,” said Daisy.", "length": "For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg, but a glance at him convinced me otherwise.", "alpha": "“Sit down, Daisy,” Tom’s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note."}, {"default": "“If we were young we’d rise and dance.”", "length": "“Miss Baker’s a great sportswoman, you know, and she’d never do anything that wasn’t all right.”", "alpha": "“Sit right down."}, {"default": "“Remember Biloxi,” Jordan warned her.", "length": "By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to suit me.", "alpha": "Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory, we started to town."}, {"default": "“Where’d you know him, Tom?”", "length": "So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star.", "alpha": "Sitting on Tom’s lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the telephone; then there were no cigarettes, and I went out to buy some at the drugstore on the corner."}, {"default": "“Biloxi?” He concentrated with an effort.", "length": "Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly.", "alpha": "Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two young women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind."}, {"default": "“I didn’t know him.", "length": "The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there was an autumn flavour in the air.", "alpha": "Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky."}, {"default": "He was a friend of Daisy’s.”", "length": "I wasn’t worth a decent stroke of work, but it was more than that—I didn’t want to leave Gatsby.", "alpha": "Snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett’s automobile ran over his right hand."}, {"default": "“He was not,” she denied.", "length": "I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn’t believe it would come, and perhaps he no longer cared.", "alpha": "So I don’t know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Island, or for how many hours he “glanced into rooms” while his house blazed gaudily on."}, {"default": "“I’d never seen him before.", "length": "The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly, and as he shook his head his eyes filled with tears.", "alpha": "So I take advantage of this short halt, while Gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of misconceptions away."}, {"default": "He came down in the private car.”", "length": "All I kept thinking about, over and over, was ‘You can’t live forever; you can’t live forever.’ ”", "alpha": "So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight—watching over nothing."}, {"default": "“Well, he said he knew you.", "length": "“But I swore I wouldn’t tell it and here I am tantalizing you.” She yawned gracefully in my face.", "alpha": "So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York—or not quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car."}, {"default": "He said he was raised in Louisville.", "length": "I think that, except for my presence, he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table.", "alpha": "So Wilson was reduced to a man “deranged by grief” in order that the case might remain in its simplest form."}, {"default": "Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him.”", "length": "Then I went out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there together.", "alpha": "“So are we.”"}, {"default": "Jordan smiled.", "length": "“We don’t go around very much,” he said; “in fact, I was just thinking I don’t know a soul here.”", "alpha": "So by that time he knew Gatsby’s name."}, {"default": "“He was probably bumming his way home.", "length": "I used to laugh sometimes”—but there was no laughter in his eyes—“to think that you didn’t know.”", "alpha": "So did Gatsby’s father."}, {"default": "He told me he was president of your class at Yale.”", "length": "In a little while I heard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face.", "alpha": "So engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture."}, {"default": "Tom and I looked at each other blankly.", "length": "As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark road toward the house.", "alpha": "So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end."}, {"default": "“Biloxi?”", "length": "Now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair.", "alpha": "So he made the most of his time."}, {"default": "“First place, we didn’t have any president—”", "length": "But Wilson stood there a long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight.", "alpha": "So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning-fork that had been struck upon a star."}, {"default": "Gatsby’s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.", "length": "When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.", "alpha": "So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavoured conversation in his halls."}, {"default": "“By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you’re an Oxford man.”", "length": "“It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train.", "alpha": "So my first impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate roadhouse next door."}, {"default": "“Not exactly.”", "length": "This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness.", "alpha": "So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson wouldn’t say a word—instead he began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what he’d been doing at certain times on certain days."}, {"default": "“Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.”", "length": "“It was four o’clock in the morning then, and if we’d of raised the blinds we’d of seen daylight.”", "alpha": "So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes."}, {"default": "“Yes—I went there.”", "length": "I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older girls I admired her most.", "alpha": "So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."}, {"default": "A pause.", "length": "She was effectually prevented, but she wasn’t on speaking terms with her family for several weeks.", "alpha": "“So we did."}, {"default": "Then Tom’s voice, incredulous and insulting:", "length": "It’s too late!” He looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere.", "alpha": "So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight."}, {"default": "“You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.”", "length": "“I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife.", "alpha": "So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to come back home."}, {"default": "Another pause.", "length": "When they met again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless, who was, somehow, betrayed.", "alpha": "“So you are.”"}, {"default": "A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but the silence was unbroken by his “thank you” and the soft closing of the door.", "length": "My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle Western city for three generations.", "alpha": "“Some big bootlegger?”"}, {"default": "This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.", "length": "Now he was a sturdy straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner.", "alpha": "Some coat."}, {"default": "“I told you I went there,” said Gatsby.", "length": "“—And we’ve produced all the things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all that.", "alpha": "Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom."}, {"default": "“I heard you, but I’d like to know when.”", "length": "But immediately she turned sharply from the window and, leaning forward, tapped on the front glass.", "alpha": "Some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall; when I told them who had arrived, they went reluctantly away."}, {"default": "“It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months.", "length": "“Ask Myrtle,” said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as Mrs. Wilson entered with a tray.", "alpha": "Some man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw."}, {"default": "That’s why I can’t really call myself an Oxford man.”", "length": "“There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing like that,” said the other girl eagerly.", "alpha": "Some time before he introduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care."}, {"default": "Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief.", "length": "Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.", "alpha": "Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs. Wilson had any right to mention Daisy’s name."}, {"default": "But we were all looking at Gatsby.", "length": "“He’s a bootlegger,” said the young ladies, moving somewhere between his cocktails and his flowers.", "alpha": "“Some weather!… Hot!… Hot!… Hot!… Is it hot enough for you?"}, {"default": "“It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the armistice,” he continued.", "length": "They shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsby’s face.", "alpha": "Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his grasping cries:"}, {"default": "“We could go to any of the universities in England or France.”", "length": "I remember being surprised by his graceful, conservative foxtrot—I had never seen him dance before.", "alpha": "Somebody fainted."}, {"default": "I wanted to get up and slap him on the back.", "length": "“We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: ‘There’s somebody that needs your help, Doc.’ ”", "alpha": "“Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.”"}, {"default": "I had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that I’d experienced before.", "length": "Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding its senselessness into forms.", "alpha": "Somebody told me—”"}, {"default": "Daisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.", "length": "His hand, trembling with his effort at self-control, bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale.", "alpha": "Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation."}, {"default": "“Open the whisky, Tom,” she ordered, “and I’ll make you a mint julep.", "length": "Mavro Michaelis wasn’t even sure of its colour—he told the first policeman that it was light green.", "alpha": "Someone started to ask me questions, but I broke away and going upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk—he’d never told me definitely that his parents were dead."}, {"default": "Then you won’t seem so stupid to yourself… Look at the mint!”", "length": "On the last afternoon before he went abroad, he sat with Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time.", "alpha": "Someone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and the policeman turned away."}, {"default": "“Wait a minute,” snapped Tom, “I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question.”", "length": "I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her instinctively and without hesitation.", "alpha": "Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the expression “madman” as he bent over Wilson’s body that afternoon, and the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning."}, {"default": "“Go on,” Gatsby said politely.", "length": "At this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfshiem’s, called “Stella!” from the other side of the door.", "alpha": "Someone, kind or curious, took her in his car and drove her in the wake of her sister’s body."}, {"default": "“What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?”", "length": "His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the house—” He broke off defiantly.", "alpha": "Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s “I think he killed a man,” and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity."}, {"default": "They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.", "length": "Americans, while willing, even eager, to be serfs, have always been obstinate about being peasantry.", "alpha": "Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens."}, {"default": "“He isn’t causing a row,” Daisy looked desperately from one to the other.", "length": "They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand; Gatsby didn’t know me now at all.", "alpha": "Something made him turn away from the window and look back into the room."}, {"default": "“You’re causing a row.", "length": "Our eyes lifted over the rose-beds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dog-days alongshore.", "alpha": "Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart."}, {"default": "Please have a little self-control.”", "length": "“They carried him into my house,” appended Jordan, “because we lived just two doors from the church.", "alpha":

seven o’clock when we got into the coupé with him and started for Long Island.", "length": "I waited but she didn’t say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter.", "alpha": "The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph, glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and colour under the constantly changing light."}, {"default": "Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but his voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamour on the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated

know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—”", "alpha": "The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was converted into impressive hauteur."}, {"default": "“I’ve got my wife locked in up there,” explained Wilson calmly.", "length": "But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days, under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.", "alpha": "The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner."}, {"default": "“She’s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow, and then we’re going to move away.”", "length": "Suddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room, leaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem

boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms."}, {"default": "Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t working, he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road.", "length": "The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the

instantly asleep.", "alpha": "“The last one was the one I met you at,” answered the girl, in an alert confident voice."}, {"default": "So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson wouldn’t say a word—instead he began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what he’d been doing at certain times on certain days.", "length": "That night an obviously frightened person called up, and demanded to know who I was before he would give his name.", "alpha": "The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from New

his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye."}, {"default": "He supposed he forgot to, that’s all.", "length": "For some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which overhung the terrace.", "alpha": "The lawn started at the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run."}, {"default": "When he came outside again, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation because he heard Mrs. Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in the garage.", "length": "A man named Klipspringer was there so often that he became known as “the boarder”—I doubt if he had any other home.", "alpha": "The letter reached Gatsby while he was still at Oxford."}, {"default": "“Beat me!” he heard her cry.", "length": "He was never quite still; there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.", "alpha": "The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher."}, {"default": "“Throw me down and beat me, you dirty little coward!”", "length": "He hurried the phrase “educated at Oxford,” or swallowed it, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before.", "alpha": "The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly."}, {"default": "A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and shouting—before he could move from his door the business was over.", "length": "Daisy’s face, tipped sideways beneath a three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile.", "alpha": "The living-room was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it, so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles."}, {"default": "The “death car” as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop; it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then disappeared around the next bend.", "length": "“If you want to kiss me any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I’ll be glad to arrange it for you.", "alpha": "“The man bending over her is her director.”"}, {"default": "Mavro Michaelis wasn’t even sure of its colour—he told the first policeman that it was light green.", "length": "“That’s because your mother wanted to show you off.” Her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small white neck.", "alpha": "The man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck."}, {"default": "The other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark blood with the dust.", "length": "We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened too against the heat, and drank down nervous gaiety with the cold ale.", "alpha": "“The master’s body?” roared the butler into the mouthpiece."}, {"default": "Michaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn open her shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath.", "length": "With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and, breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank.", "alpha": "The minister glanced several times at his watch, so I took him aside and asked him to wait for half an hour."}, {"default": "The mouth was wide open and ripped a little at the corners, as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long.",

the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away.", "length": "It all happened in a minute, but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew.", "alpha": "The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn."},

I went up to New York to see Meyer Wolfshiem; I couldn’t seem to reach him any other way."}, {"default": "“That’s good.", "length": "For a while the door of the office was open, and everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it.", "alpha": "The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night."}, {"default": "Wilson’ll have a little business at last.”",

the hushed, intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes.", "length": "But I wanted to leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away.", "alpha": "The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether."}, {"default": "“We’ll take a look,” he said doubtfully, “just a look.”", "length": "We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started, but we got gyped out of it all in two days in the private rooms.", "alpha": "The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of “Yea—ea—ea!” and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began."}, {"default": "I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walked toward the door resolved itself into the words “Oh, my God!” uttered over and over in a gasping moan.", "length": "Everybody kept saying to me: ‘Lucille, that man’s way below you!’ But if I hadn’t met Chester, he’d of got me sure.”", "alpha": "The name sounded faintly familiar."},

eyes."}, {"default": "He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage, which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal basket overhead.", "length": "Of theatrical people there were Gus Waize and Horace O’Donavan and Lester Myer and George Duckweed and Francis Bull.", "alpha": "The next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for a year."},

added, coolly: “He’s the man who fixed the World’s Series back in 1919.”", "alpha": "The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of the summer."}, {"default": "The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it was a minute before I could see anything at all.", "length": "“Here, dearies.” She groped around in a wastebasket she had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls.", "alpha": "The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there was an autumn flavour in the air."}, {"default": "Then new arrivals deranged the line, and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.", "length": "His bedroom was the simplest room of all—except where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold.", "alpha": "The none too savoury ramifications by which Ella Kaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht, were common property of the turgid journalism in 1902."},

us, was bending over it, motionless.", "length": "After all, in the very casualness of Gatsby’s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world.", "alpha": "The notion originated with Daisy’s suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as “a place to have a mint julep.” Each of us said over and over that it was a “crazy idea”—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny…"}, {"default": "Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in a little book.", "length": "He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers.", "alpha": "The nurse took a step forward and held out her hand."}, {"default": "At first I couldn’t find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare garage—then I saw Wilson standing on the

well-forgotten dreams from age to age.", "alpha": "The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since."}, {"default": "Some man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor

Ga-od!", "length": "Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didn’t know that the party was over.", "alpha": "The one on my right was a colossal affair by any

lawn and garden."}, {"default": "Oh, my Ga-od!", "length": "They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained.", "alpha": "The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street ministering to it, and contiguous to absolutely nothing."}, {"default": "Oh, Ga-od!", "length": "They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away.", "alpha": "The only completely stationary object in the room

son-of-a-bitch,” he said."}, {"default": "“Instantly killed,” repeated Tom, staring.", "length": "Before I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.", "alpha": "The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea."}, {"default": "“She ran out ina road.", "length": "The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesn’t know what she’s doing.” He nodded sagely.", "alpha": "The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back."}, {"default": "Son-of-a-bitch didn’t even stopus car.”", "length": "Human sympathy has its limits, and we were content to let all their tragic arguments fade with the city lights behind.", "alpha": "The quiet lights in the houses were

swam like dew."}, {"default": "“Going where?” asked the policeman keenly.", "length": "The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of transit, a thin red circle in the

because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan’s mistress.", "alpha": "The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside."}, {"default": "A pale well-dressed negro stepped near.", "length": "His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day.", "alpha": "The room was large and

across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves."}, {"default": "Going fifty, sixty.”", "length": "There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic.", "alpha": "The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs."}, {"default": "“Come here and let’s have your name.", "length": "There’s something very sensuous about it—overripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.”",

examined the parted string, muttered “Hum!” in an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.", "alpha": "The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that I was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbour’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars."}, {"default": "I want to get his name.”", "length": "I tried four times; finally an exasperated central told me the wire was being kept open for long distance from Detroit.", "alpha": "The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch."}, {"default": "Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his grasping cries:", "length": "She convinced herself of it, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the very suggestion was more than she could endure.", "alpha": "The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty, with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky white."}, {"default": "“You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it was!", "length": "He drew me into his office, remarking in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered me a cigar.", "alpha": "The smile comprehended Montenegro’s troubled history and sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people."}, {"default": "I know what kind of car it was!”", "length": "There was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant thing that perhaps had better have been let alone.", "alpha": "The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry."}, {"default": "Watching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat.",

turning over in my mind ever since.", "alpha": "The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties, and the clear voices of children, already gathered like crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:"}, {"default": "“You’ve got to pull yourself together,” he said with soothing gruffness.", "length": "Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes, but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on.", "alpha": "The supercilious assumption was that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do."}, {"default": "Wilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.", "length": "Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming, discontented face.", "alpha": "The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky colour, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets."}, {"default": "“Listen,” said Tom, shaking him a little.", "length": "When she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms.", "alpha": "The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, “Excuse me”—but this time no one laughed."}, {"default": "“I just got here a minute ago, from New York.", "length": "The smile comprehended Montenegro’s troubled history and sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people.", "alpha": "The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air."}, {"default": "I was bringing you that coupé we’ve been talking about.", "length": "A few days later he took him to Duluth and bought him a blue coat, six pairs of white duck trousers, and a yachting cap.", "alpha": "The thing approached the proportions of a scandal—then died away."}, {"default": "That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn’t mine—do you hear?", "length": "It was dark here in front; only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning.", "alpha": "“The thing to do is to forget about the heat,” said Tom impatiently."}, {"default": "I haven’t seen it all afternoon.”", "length": "He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.", "alpha": "The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly."}, {"default": "Only the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes.", "length": "Then as Doctor T.

thin red circle in the water."}, {"default": "“What’s all that?” he demanded.", "length": "His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes.", "alpha": "The track curved and now it was going away from the sun, which, as it sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city where she had drawn her breath."}, {"default": "“I’m a friend of his.” Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on Wilson’s body.", "length": "What could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that couldn’t be measured?", "alpha": "The transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and, suspecting this, an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money."}, {"default": "“He says he knows the car that did it… It was a yellow car.”", "length": "He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it.", "alpha": "The transition from libertine to prig was so complete."}, {"default": "Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.", "length": "It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further… And one fine morning—", "alpha": "The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesn’t know what she’s doing.” He nodded sagely."}, {"default": "“And what colour’s your car?”", "length": "The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house.", "alpha": "The truth was that Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself."}, {"default": "“It’s a blue car, a coupé.”", "length": "Her husband said “Sh!” and we all looked at the subject again, whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.", "alpha": "The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially."}, {"default": "“We’ve come straight from New York,” I said.", "length": "I wanted to explain that I’d hunted for him early in the evening and to apologize for not having known him in the garden.", "alpha": "The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way."}, {"default": "Someone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and the policeman turned away.", "length": "The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained “Ah-h-h!” as the door of the coupé swung slowly open.", "alpha": "The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and, when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour."}, {"default": "“Now, if you’ll let me have that name again correct—”", "length": "I said to myself: ‘There’s the kind of man you’d like to take home and introduce to your mother and sister.’ ” He paused.", "alpha": "The very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a turbaned “character” leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne."}, {"default": "Picking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, set him down in a chair, and came back.", "length": "It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment.", "alpha": "The voice begged again to go."}, {"default": "“If somebody’ll come here and sit with him,” he snapped authoritatively.", "length": "They were still under the white-plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale, thin ray of moonlight between.", "alpha": "The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance: “Very well, then, I won’t sell you the car at all… I’m under no obligations to you at all… and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, I won’t stand that at all!”"}, {"default": "He watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room.", "length": "That anyone should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed, whose head made damp the pyjama pocket over his heart!", "alpha": "“The whole town is desolate."}, {"default": "Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the table.", "length": "Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then his foot came down hard, and the coupé raced along through the night.", "alpha": "The wind had blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life."}, {"default": "As he passed close to me he whispered: “Let’s get out.”", "length": "After that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby—one gentleman to whom I telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved.", "alpha": "The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house."}, {"default": "Self-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we pushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor, case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.", "length": "I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall.", "alpha": "The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices."}, {"default": "Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then his foot came down hard, and the coupé raced along through the night.", "length": "She told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven times since they had been married.", "alpha": "The word “sensuous” had the effect of further disquieting Tom, but before he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop, and Daisy signalled us to draw up alongside."}, {"default": "In a little while I heard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face.", "length": "The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly.", "alpha": "The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby."}, {"default": "“The God damned coward!” he whimpered.", "length": "“Let’s get out,” whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half-hour; “this is much too polite for me.”", "alpha": "The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the ash-heaps was the principal witness at the inquest."},

younger of the two was a stranger to me."}, {"default": "The Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees.", "length": "When Klipspringer had played “The Love Nest” he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom.", "alpha": "The “death car” as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop; it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then disappeared around the next bend."}, {"default": "Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.", "length": "But he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for.", "alpha": "Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space."}, {"default": "“Daisy’s home,” he said.", "length": "Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.", "alpha": "Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay."}, {"default": "As we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly.", "length": "It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an archway through which were visible a host of spires.", "alpha": "Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away."}, {"default": "“I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick.", "length": "A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night, and ripped a front wheel off his car.", "alpha": "Then I got up…”"}, {"default": "There’s nothing we can do tonight.”", "length": "Daisy took the brush with delight, and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh.", "alpha": "Then I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door."}, {"default": "A change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision.", "length": "He never understood the legal device that was used against him, but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye.", "alpha": "Then I leaned back in my chair and tried to think."}, {"default": "As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phrases.", "length": "After the armistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead.", "alpha": "Then I turned back to Gatsby—and was startled at his expression."}, {"default": "“I’ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you’re waiting you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supper—if you want any.” He opened the door.", "length": "Michaelis didn’t see anything odd in that, and he gave Wilson a dozen reasons why his wife might have bought the dog-leash.", "alpha": "Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the house, intending to wait by the gate."}, {"default": "“Come in.”", "length": "He was on the point of collapse, so I took him into the music-room and made him sit down while I sent for something to eat.", "alpha": "Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand."}, {"default": "“No, thanks.", "length": "And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all.", "alpha": "Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the Pennsylvania Station, staring at the morning Tribune, and waiting for the four o’clock train."}, {"default": "But I’d be glad if you’d order me the taxi.", "length": "I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East, and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.", "alpha": "Then I went out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there together."}, {"default": "I’ll wait outside.”", "length": "I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from England with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground.",

my towels—while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.", "alpha": "Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the table."}, {"default": "“Won’t you come in, Nick?”",

even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay.", "alpha": "“Then came the war, old sport."}, {"default": "But Jordan lingered for a moment more.", "length": "She smiled slowly and, walking through her husband as if he were a ghost, shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in the eye.", "alpha": "Then for three hours he disappeared from view."}, {"default": "“It’s only half-past nine,” she said.", "length": "We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host: I had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy.", "alpha": "Then from the living-room I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh, followed by Daisy’s voice on a clear artificial note:"}, {"default": "I’d be damned if I’d go in; I’d had enough of all of them for one day, and suddenly that included Jordan too.", "length": "There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden.", "alpha": "Then he began asking people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found."}, {"default": "She must have seen something of this in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house.", "length": "It appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had elicited this tribute from Montenegro’s warm little heart.", "alpha": "Then he drifted back to Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day that Dan Cody’s yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore."}, {"default": "I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler’s voice calling a taxi.", "length": "Blinking away the brightness of the street outside, my eyes picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.", "alpha": "Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn’t to be taken out under any circumstances—and this was strange, because the front right fender needed repair."}, {"default": "Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the house, intending to wait by the gate.", "length": "He literally glowed; without a word

movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through."}, {"default": "“What are you doing?” I inquired.", "length": "“He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street drugstores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter.", "alpha": "Then he returned the wallet and pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called Hopalong Cassidy."}, {"default": "“Just standing here, old sport.”", "length": "“Of course she might have loved him just for a minute, when they were first married—and loved me more even then, do you see?”", "alpha": "Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand."}, {"default": "Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation.", "length": "I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl.", "alpha": "Then he went into the jewellery store to buy a pearl necklace—or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons—rid of my provincial squeamishness forever."}, {"default": "For all I knew he was going to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn’t have been surprised to see sinister faces, the faces of “Wolfshiem’s people,” behind him in the dark shrubbery.", "length": "The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said.", "alpha": "Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that June night."}, {"default": "“Did you see any trouble on the road?” he asked after a minute.", "length": "Then I heard footsteps on a stairs, and in a moment

side, and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.", "alpha": "Then it was something more."}, {"default": "He hesitated.", "length": "‘This is the first I ever heard about it.’

she killed?”", "length": "I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say.", "alpha": "Then out into the spring fields,

was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no choice except to cut him off there.", "alpha": "Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on."}, {"default": "“I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so.", "length": "“Oh, the grass in the yard.” He looked out the window at it, but, judging from his expression, I don’t believe he saw a thing.", "alpha": "Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there."}, {"default": "It’s better that the shock should all come at once.", "length": "When he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes were bright and tired.", "alpha": "Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room."}, {"default": "She stood it pretty well.”", "length": "She must have seen something of this in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house.", "alpha": "Then she wet her lips, and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:"}, {"default": "He spoke as if Daisy’s reaction was the only thing that mattered.", "length": "There was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere, and the rooms were musty, as though they hadn’t been aired for many days.",

to say goodbye.", "alpha": "Then the same half-knowing, half-bewildered look came back into his faded eyes."}, {"default": "I disliked him so much by this time that I didn’t find it necessary to tell him he was wrong.", "length": "As for Tom, the fact that he “had some woman in New York” was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book.", "alpha": "Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a glimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we went by."}, {"default": "“Who was the woman?” he inquired.", "length": "But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel.", "alpha": "Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor."}, {"default": "“Her name was Wilson.", "length": "A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril.", "alpha": "Then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women’s voices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of pain."}, {"default": "Her husband owns the garage.", "length": "Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace.", "alpha": "Then they sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour, while at her request I remained watchfully in the garden."}, {"default": "How the devil did it happen?”", "length": "Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five.", "alpha": "“Then you ought to leave it alone,” countered Doctor Civet."}, {"default": "“Well, I tried to swing the wheel—” He broke off, and suddenly I guessed at the truth.", "length": "So I take advantage of this short halt, while Gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of misconceptions away.", "alpha": "Then you won’t seem so stupid to yourself… Look at the mint!”"}, {"default": "“Was Daisy driving?”", "length": "“I’d a little rather not be the polo player,” said Tom pleasantly, “I’d rather look at all these famous people in—in oblivion.”", "alpha": "Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders, he remarked in a determined voice:"}, {"default": "“Yes,” he said after a moment, “but of course I’ll say I was.", "length": "“Very romantic,” he said, and then miserably to me: “If it’s light enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.”", "alpha": "Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe."}, {"default": "You see, when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to drive—and this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way.", "length": "To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police.", "alpha": "Then, with reluctance: “I want to get the grass cut,” he said."}, {"default": "It all happened in a minute, but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew.", "length": "She came in with such a proprietary haste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered if she lived here.", "alpha": "Then:"}, {"default": "Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back.", "length": "I had a woman up here last week to look at my feet, and when she gave me the bill you’d of thought she had my appendicitis out.”", "alpha": "“There aren’t any more.”"}, {"default": "The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock—it must have killed her instantly.”", "length": "Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s “I think he killed a man,” and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity.", "alpha": "“There haven’t been any wires.”"}, {"default": "“It ripped her open—”", "length": "In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust.", "alpha": "There is always a halt there of at least a minute, and it was because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan’s mistress."}, {"default": "“Don’t tell me, old sport.” He winced.", "length": "The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a greenhouse arrived from Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it.", "alpha": "There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic."}, {"default": "“Anyhow—Daisy stepped on it.", "length": "He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physically sick.", "alpha": "There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams—not through her own fault, but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion."}, {"default": "I tried to make her stop, but she couldn’t, so I pulled on the emergency brake.", "length": "In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car.", "alpha": "There was Gatsby, looking a little, not much, younger—with a cricket bat in his hand."}, {"default": "Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.", "length": "Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time.”", "alpha": "There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other."}, {"default": "“She’ll be all right tomorrow,” he said presently.", "length": "“Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?” There was a husky tenderness in his tone… “Daisy?”", "alpha": "There was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an exclamation… then a quick squawk as the connection was broken."}, {"default": "“I’m just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon.", "length": "About three o’clock the quality of Wilson’s incoherent muttering changed—he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car.", "alpha": "There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler’s thumb."}, {"default": "She’s locked herself into her room, and if he tries any brutality she’s going to turn the light out and on again.”", "length": "There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.", "alpha": "There was a moment of silence."}, {"default": "“He won’t touch her,” I said.", "length": "There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more.", "alpha": "There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered."}, {"default": "“He’s not thinking about her.”", "length": "The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner.", "alpha": "There was a slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool, lovely day."}, {"default": "“I don’t trust him, old sport.”", "length": "“Oh, sure,” agreed Wilson hurriedly, and went toward the little office, mingling immediately with the cement colour of the walls.", "alpha": "There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the bureau—Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly—taken apparently when he was about eighteen."}, {"default": "“How long are you going to wait?”", "length": "It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life.", "alpha": "There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts."}, {"default": "“All night, if necessary.", "length": "His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the room—he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind.", "alpha": "There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position, and Daisy was flattered."}, {"default": "Anyhow, till they all go to bed.”", "length": "He waited a moment longer, hoping I’d begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went unwillingly home.", "alpha": "There was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere, and the rooms were musty, as though they hadn’t been aired for many days."}, {"default": "A new point of view occurred to me.", "length": "He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years when he turned up as James Gatz’s destiny in Little Girl Bay.", "alpha": "There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together."}, {"default": "Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had been driving.", "length": "I looked at the house; there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the ground floor.", "alpha": "There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden; old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples holding each other tortuously, fashionably, and keeping in the corners—and a great number of single girls dancing individually or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps."}, {"default": "He might think he saw a connection in it—he might think anything.", "length": "A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden.", "alpha": "There was music from my neighbour’s house through the summer nights."}, {"default": "I looked at the house; there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the ground floor.", "length": "Father agreed to finance me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.", "alpha": "There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it wasn’t true."}, {"default": "“You wait here,” I said.", "length": "Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.", "alpha": "There was nothing in it but a small, expensive dog-leash, made of leather and braided silver."}, {"default": "“I’ll see if there’s any sign of a commotion.”", "length": "Only wind in the trees, which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness.", "alpha": "There was nothing to look at from under the tree except Gatsby’s enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church steeple, for half an hour."}, {"default": "I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly, and tiptoed up the veranda steps.", "length": "We both looked down at the grass—there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began.", "alpha": "There was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant thing that perhaps had better have been let alone."}, {"default": "The drawing-room curtains were open, and I saw that the room was empty.", "length": "“I thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon my—you see, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of side line, you understand.", "alpha": "There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air."}, {"default": "Crossing the porch where we had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window.", "length": "As Gatsby closed the door of “the Merton College Library” I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into ghostly laughter.", "alpha": "There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more."}, {"default": "The blind was drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.", "length": "She turned to me, and her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: “Do you know why we left Chicago?", "alpha": "There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden."}, {"default": "Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table, with a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of ale.", "length": "Wilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.", "alpha": "There was the smile again, but this time I held out against it."}, {"default": "He was talking intently across the table at her, and in his earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own.", "length": "If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream.", "alpha": "“There was two cars,” said Michaelis, “one comin’, one goin’, see?”"}, {"default": "Once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.", "length": "It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found marvelling over Gatsby’s books in the library one night three months before.", "alpha": "“There wasn’t any connection.”"}, {"default": "They weren’t happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the ale—and yet they weren’t unhappy either.", "length": "We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end.", "alpha": "There were generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the library, so it was a good place to work."}, {"default": "There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together.", "length": "Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passersby.", "alpha": "There were the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-coloured, many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn’t been there before."}, {"default": "As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark road toward the house.", "length": "“You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and your—” He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his hand.", "alpha": "There were three married couples and Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo, and obviously under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree."}, {"default": "Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in the drive.", "length": "An hour later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold-coloured tie, hurried in.", "alpha": "“There, Jay,” she said—but her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling."}, {"default": "“Is it all quiet up there?” he asked anxiously.", "length": "I went in—after making every possible noise in the kitchen, short of pushing over the stove—but I don’t believe they heard a sound.", "alpha": "There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line."}, {"default": "“Yes, it’s all quiet.” I hesitated.", "length": "Daisy’s face was smeared with tears, and when I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before a mirror.", "alpha": "“There’s another little thing,” he said uncertainly, and hesitated."}, {"default": "“You’d better come home and get some sleep.”", "length": "All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York.", "alpha": "There’s another man in the car.”"}, {"default": "He shook his head.", "length": "Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbours for four years, and Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement.", "alpha": "“There’s nothing to get mixed up in."}, {"default": "“I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed.", "length": "I must have felt pretty weird by that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon.", "alpha": "There’s nothing we can do tonight.”"}, {"default": "Good night, old sport.”", "length": "He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go—but now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail.", "alpha": "“There’s some bad trouble here,” said Tom excitedly."}, {"default": "He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil.", "length": "Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby’s party.", "alpha": "“There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing like that,” said the other girl eagerly."}, {"default": "So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight—watching over nothing.", "length": "A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and shouting—before he could move from his door the business was over.", "alpha": "There’s something very sensuous about it—overripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.”"}, {"default": "I couldn’t sleep all night; a foghorn was groaning incessantly on the Sound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage, frightening dreams.", "length": "There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together.", "alpha": "“There’s sport for you,” said Tom, nodding."}, {"default": "Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby’s drive, and immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress—I felt that I had something to tell him, something to warn him about, and morning would be too late.", "length": "There was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an exclamation… then a quick squawk as the connection was broken.", "alpha": "“These people!"}, {"default": "Crossing his lawn, I saw that his front door was still open and he was leaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.", "length": "I saw right away he was a fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told me he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good.", "alpha": "“These things excite me so,” she whispered."}, {"default": "“Nothing happened,” he said wanly.", "length": "A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing, and I began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars.", "alpha": "“They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.”"}, {"default": "“I waited, and about four o’clock she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out the light.”", "length": "Two shining arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward.", "alpha": "They are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual wonder to the gulls that fly overhead."}, {"default": "His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes.", "length": "“Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,” he said, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more.", "alpha": "They arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds, Daisy’s voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat."}, {"default": "We pushed aside curtains that were like pavilions, and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric light switches—once I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano.", "length": "So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York—or not quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car.", "alpha": "They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light."}, {"default": "There was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere, and the rooms were musty, as though they hadn’t been aired for many days.", "length": "… I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands.", "alpha": "“They can’t get him, old sport."}, {"default": "I found the humidor on an unfamiliar table, with two stale, dry cigarettes inside.", "length": "Evidently he lived in this vicinity, for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane, and was going to try it out in the morning.", "alpha": "“They carried him into my house,” appended Jordan, “because we lived just two doors from the church."}, {"default": "Throwing open the French windows of the drawing-room, we sat smoking out into the darkness.", "length": "Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I joined the last of Gatsby’s guests, who were clustered around him.", "alpha": "“They certainly look cool,” he said, with visible tension."}, {"default": "“You ought to go away,” I said.", "length": "Then from the living-room I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh, followed by Daisy’s voice on a clear artificial note:", "alpha": "They got a circular from New York giving ’em the numbers just five minutes before."}, {"default": "“It’s pretty certain they’ll trace your car.”", "length": "To young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck, that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world.", "alpha": "They got into automobiles which bore them out to Long Island, and somehow they ended up at Gatsby’s door."}, {"default": "“Go away now, old sport?”", "length": "He was left with his singularly appropriate education; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substantiality of a man.", "alpha": "They had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine."}, {"default": "“Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal.”", "length": "“Perhaps you know that lady.” Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white-plum tree.", "alpha": "They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand; Gatsby didn’t know me now at all."}, {"default": "He wouldn’t consider it.", "length": "Then they sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour, while at her request I remained watchfully in the garden.", "alpha": "They had never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with another, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep."}, {"default": "He couldn’t possibly leave Daisy until he knew what she was going to do.", "length": "I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler’s voice calling a taxi.", "alpha": "They had spent a year in France for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together."}, {"default": "He was clutching at some last hope and I couldn’t bear to shake him free.", "length": "Up in the city, I tried for a while to list the quotations on an interminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair.", "alpha": "They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away."}, {"default": "It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with Dan Cody—told it to me because “Jay Gatsby” had broken up like glass against Tom’s hard malice, and the long secret extravaganza was played out.", "length": "Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away.", "alpha": "They look out of no face, but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose."}, {"default": "I think that he would have acknowledged anything now, without reserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.", "length": "Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart.", "alpha": "They meet all kinds of crazy fish.”"}, {"default": "She was the first “nice” girl he had ever known.", "length": "We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson, who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile.", "alpha": "They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation."}, {"default": "In various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people, but always with indiscernible barbed wire between.", "length": "“Now see here, Tom,” said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, “if you’re going to make personal remarks I won’t stay here a minute.", "alpha": "“They oughtn’t to let her run around the country this way.”"}, {"default": "He found her excitingly desirable.", "length": "It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been made.", "alpha": "“They picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter."}, {"default": "He went to her house, at first with other officers from Camp Taylor, then alone.", "length": "The rain poured down his thick glasses, and he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled from Gatsby’s grave.", "alpha": "They shook hands briefly, and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsby’s face."}, {"default": "It amazed him—he had never been in such a beautiful house before.", "length": "It was a few days before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.", "alpha": "They simply force their way in and he’s too polite to object.”"}, {"default": "But what gave it an air of breathless intensity, was that Daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him.", "length": "A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: “There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and the tired.”", "alpha": "They stood side by side examining it."}, {"default": "There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s shining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered.", "length": "About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one morning at Gatsby’s door and asked him if he had anything to say.", "alpha": "They stopped here and turned toward each other."}, {"default": "It excited him, too, that many men had already loved Daisy—it increased her value in his eyes.", "length": "An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to the small Lutheran College of St. Olaf’s in southern Minnesota.", "alpha": "They used to run a small hotel.”"}, {"default": "He felt their presence all about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions.", "length": "Thirty—the promise of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning briefcase of enthusiasm, thinning hair.", "alpha": "They went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet."}, {"default": "But he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a colossal accident.", "length": "There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other.", "alpha": "They were a party of three on horseback—Tom and a man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding-habit, who had been there previously."}, {"default": "However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders.", "length": "It was Gatsby’s father, a solemn old man, very helpless and dismayed, bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day.", "alpha": "They were at least agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key."}, {"default": "So he made the most of his time.", "length": "Some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall; when I told them who had arrived, they went reluctantly away.", "alpha": "They were both in white, and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house."}, {"default": "He took what he could get, ravenously and unscrupulously—eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took her because he had no real right to touch her hand.", "length": "(I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)", "alpha": "They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made…"}, {"default": "He might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under false pretences.", "length": "It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again.", "alpha": "They were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory."}, {"default": "I don’t mean that he had traded on his phantom millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he let her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as herself—that he was fully able to take care of her.", "length": "I am, and you are, and you are, and—” After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod, and she winked at me again.", "alpha": "They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental, isolated, like ghosts, even from our pity."}, {"default": "As a matter of fact, he had no such facilities—he had no comfortable family standing behind him, and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world.", "length": "You can’t stop going with an old friend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumoured into marriage.", "alpha": "They were hard to find."}, {"default": "But he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he had imagined.", "length": "I had taken two finger-bowls of champagne, and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental, and profound.", "alpha": "They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained."}, {"default": "He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go—but now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail.", "length": "Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano.", "alpha": "They were never quite the same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before."}, {"default": "He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn’t realize just how extraordinary a “nice” girl could be.", "length": "I was sure the request would be something utterly fantastic, and for a moment I was sorry I’d ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn.", "alpha": "They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content."}, {"default": "She vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing.", "length": "We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the façade of Fifty-Ninth Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park.", "alpha": "They were sitting at either end of the couch, looking at each other as if some question had been asked, or was in the air, and every vestige of embarrassment was gone."}, {"default": "He felt married to her, that was all.", "length": "While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices,

again, two days later, it was Gatsby who was breathless, who was, somehow, betrayed.", "length": "Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out—an unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.", "alpha": "They were still under the white-plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale, thin ray of moonlight between."}, {"default": "Her porch was bright with the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth.", "length": "Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight.", "alpha": "They weren’t happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the ale—and yet they weren’t unhappy either."}, {"default": "She had caught a cold, and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever, and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes, and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor.", "length": "A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but the silence was unbroken by his “thank you” and the soft closing of the door.", "alpha": "“They’ll keep out of my way,” she insisted."}, {"default": "“I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her, old sport.", "length": "He was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and realized that dawn wasn’t far off.", "alpha": "“They’re a rotten crowd,” I shouted across the lawn."}, {"default": "I even hoped for a while that she’d throw me over, but she didn’t, because she was in love with me too.",

old sport.”"}, {"default": "What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do?”", "length": "All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black

Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time.", "length": "They were at least agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key.",

there wasn’t something a little sinister about him, after all.", "alpha": "They’re real.”"}, {"default": "Now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little, and once he kissed her dark shining hair.", "length": "Next day at five o’clock she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a three months’ trip to the South Seas.", "alpha": "They’re so intimate."}, {"default": "The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while, as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised.", "length": "Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom.", "alpha": "“They’re some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for."}, {"default": "They had never been closer in their month of love, nor communicated more profoundly one with another, than when she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep.", "length": "They arrived at twilight, and, as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds, Daisy’s voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat.", "alpha": "“They’re such beautiful shirts,” she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds."}, {"default": "He did extraordinarily well in the war.", "length": "Tom and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies.", "alpha": "They’re—”"}, {"default": "He was a captain before he went to the front, and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machine-guns.", "length": "The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, “Excuse me”—but this time no one laughed.", "alpha": "“They’ve been living over that garage for eleven years."}, {"default": "After the armistice he tried frantically to get home, but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead.", "length": "Wilson was quieter now, and Michaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage, Wilson was gone.", "alpha": "Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up his position.”"}, {"default": "He was worried now—there was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy’s letters.", "length": "I helped him to a bedroom upstairs; while he took off his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been deferred until he came.", "alpha": "“Things went from bad to worse,” suggested Miss Baker."}, {"default": "She didn’t see why he couldn’t come.", "length": "A white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity—except his wife, who moved close to Tom.", "alpha": "Thirty—the promise of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning briefcase of enthusiasm, thinning hair."}, {"default": "She was feeling the pressure of the world outside, and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all.", "length": "Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her.", "alpha": "“This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour—” I began."}, {"default": "For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes.", "length": "The girl who was with him got into the papers, too, because her arm was broken—she was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.", "alpha": "This absorbing information about my neighbour was interrupted by Mrs. McKee’s pointing suddenly at Catherine:"}, {"default": "All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the “Beale Street Blues” while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust.", "length": "Once more it was pouring, and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsby’s gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes.",

blown by the sad horns around the floor.", "length": "The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west, and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea.", "alpha": "This fella’s a regular Belasco."}, {"default": "Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening-dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed.", "length": "Sometimes in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone.", "alpha": "“This fellow has worked out the whole thing."}, {"default": "And all the time something within her was crying for a decision.", "length": "As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon.", "alpha": "“This has been a strain to you and you don’t know what you’re saying."}, {"default": "She wanted her life shaped now, immediately—and the decision must be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality—that was close at hand.", "length": "“I’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,” Tom was saying to Gatsby, “but I’m the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.”", "alpha": "This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all."}, {"default": "That force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom Buchanan.", "length": "Crossing his lawn, I saw that his front door was still open and he was leaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep.", "alpha": "“This idea is that we’re Nordics."}, {"default": "There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position, and Daisy was flattered.", "length": "He stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him.", "alpha": "This included me."}, {"default": "Doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief.",

chorus, engaged in song.", "alpha": "“This is Mr. Carraway,” I said."}, {"default": "It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey-turning, gold-turning light.", "length": "When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park.", "alpha": "“This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.”"}, {"default": "The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves.", "length": "Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.", "alpha": "“This is Slagle speaking…”"}, {"default": "There was a slow, pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool, lovely day.", "length": "But it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it, the freshest and the best, forever.", "alpha": "“This is a nice restaurant here,” said Mr. Wolfshiem, looking at the presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling."}, {"default": "“I don’t think she ever loved him.” Gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly.", "length": "He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him to pump it up.", "alpha": "“This is a terrible mistake,” he said, shaking his head from side to side, “a terrible, terrible mistake.”"}, {"default": "“You must remember, old sport, she was very excited this afternoon.", "length": "As we started through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground.", "alpha": "This is a valley of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and, finally, with a transcendent effort, of ash-grey men, who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air."}, {"default": "He told her those things in a way that frightened her—that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper.", "length": "“He came to the door while we were getting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we weren’t in he tried to force his way upstairs.", "alpha": "“This is an unusual party for me."}, {"default": "And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.”", "length": "Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighbourhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases, and went haughtily in.", "alpha": "“This is just a friend."}, {"default": "He sat down gloomily.", "length": "Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy, and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there.", "alpha": "“This is one of his sentimental days."}, {"default": "“Of course she might have loved him just for a minute, when they were first married—and loved me more even then, do you see?”", "length": "I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gave me a decoration—even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea!”", "alpha": "‘This is the first I ever heard about it.’ But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon.”"}, {"default": "Suddenly he came out with a curious remark.", "length": "So I don’t know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Island, or for how many hours he “glanced into rooms” while his house blazed gaudily on.", "alpha": "This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness."}, {"default": "“In any case,” he said, “it was just personal.”", "length": "Gatsby got himself into a shadow and, while Daisy and I talked, looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense, unhappy eyes.", "alpha": "This reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back, so I drove into West Egg Village to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers."}, {"default": "What could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that couldn’t be measured?", "length": "A massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker’s defence:", "alpha": "This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the “creative temperament”—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again."}, {"default": "He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding trip, and made a miserable but irresistible journey to Louisville on the last of his army pay.", "length": "“She’s much obliged, I’m sure,” said another friend, without gratitude, “but you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool.”", "alpha": "This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently."}, {"default": "He stayed there a week, walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which they had driven in her white car.", "length": "Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.", "alpha": "This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last."}, {"default": "Just as Daisy’s house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses, so his idea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded with a melancholy beauty.", "length": "He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by.", "alpha": "This was a forlorn hope—he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend: there was not enough of him for his wife."}, {"default": "He left feeling that if he had searched harder, he might have found her—that he was leaving her behind.", "length": "At two o’clock Gatsby put on his bathing-suit and left word with the butler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool.", "alpha": "This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into Daisy’s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game."}, {"default": "The day-coach—he was penniless now—was hot.", "length": "I went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that they were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it.", "alpha": "This was his day off and with laudable initiative he had hurried out “to see.”"}, {"default": "He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by.", "length": "Dimly I heard someone murmur “Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,” and then the owl-eyed man said “Amen to that,” in a brave voice.", "alpha": "This was untrue."}, {"default": "Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street.", "length": "The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear, whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went inside.", "alpha": "“This?” he inquired, holding it up."}, {"default": "The track curved and now it was going away from the sun, which, as it sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city where she had drawn her breath.", "length": "Looked at from a distance, however, the hen resolved itself into a bonnet, and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room.", "alpha": "“Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,” suggested Jordan."}, {"default": "He stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him.", "length": "“Chester, I think you could do something with her,” she broke out, but Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way, and turned his attention to Tom.", "alpha": "Those who went farther than Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o’clock of a December evening, with a few Chicago friends, already caught up into their own holiday gaieties, to bid them a hasty goodbye."}, {"default": "But it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it, the freshest and the best, forever.", "length": "I live over there—” I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, “and this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.”", "alpha": "Though I was curious to see her, I had no desire to meet her—but I did."}, {"default": "It was nine o’clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the porch.", "length": "A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two carriages with drawn blinds, and by more cheerful carriages for friends.", "alpha": "“Three o’clock, here at the house."}, {"default": "The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there was an autumn flavour in the air.", "length": "As we crossed Blackwell’s Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white chauffeur, in which sat three modish negroes, two bucks and a girl.", "alpha": "Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard somewhere a long time ago."}, {"default": "The gardener, the last one of Gatsby’s former servants, came to the foot of the steps.", "length": "When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet.", "alpha": "Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men, and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening-dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed."}, {"default": "“I’m going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby.", "length": "I think that voice held him most, with its fluctuating, feverish warmth, because it couldn’t be over-dreamed—that voice was a deathless song.", "alpha": "“Throw me down and beat me, you dirty little coward!”"}, {"default": "Leaves’ll start falling pretty soon, and then there’s always trouble with the pipes.”", "length": "At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of them elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick and extravagantly ambitious.", "alpha": "Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighbourhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases, and went haughtily in."}, {"default": "“Don’t do it today,” Gatsby answered.", "length": "They were a party of three on horseback—Tom and a man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding-habit, who had been there previously.", "alpha": "Throwing open the French windows of the drawing-room, we sat smoking out into the darkness."}, {"default": "He turned to me apologetically.", "length": "One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back to Louisville and be married from her house—just as if it were five years ago.", "alpha": "Thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for his time—there were boys who had seen a man “acting sort of crazy,” and motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road."}, {"default": "“You know, old sport, I’ve never used that pool all summer?”", "length": "Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table, with a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of ale.", "alpha": "“Time for this good girl to go to bed.”"}, {"default": "I looked at my watch and stood up.", "length": "He had just shaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room.", "alpha": "To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police."}, {"default": "“Twelve minutes to my train.”", "length": "It faced—or seemed to face—the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour.", "alpha": "“To be continued,” she said, tossing the magazine on the table, “in our very next issue.”"}, {"default": "I didn’t want to go to the city.", "length": "Everyone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known.", "alpha": "To my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look."}, {"default": "I wasn’t worth a decent stroke of work, but it was more than that—I didn’t want to leave Gatsby.", "length": "“Look at that,” she whispered, and then after a moment: “I’d like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around.”", "alpha": "To my overwhelming surprise the living-room was deserted."}, {"default": "I missed that train, and then another, before I could get myself away.", "length": "“It seems that pretty soon the earth’s going to fall into the sun—or wait a minute—it’s just the opposite—the sun’s getting colder every year.", "alpha": "To the wingless a more interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size."}, {"default": "“I’ll call you up,” I said finally.", "length": "Some man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw.", "alpha": "To young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck, that yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world."}, {"default": "“Do, old sport.”", "length": "The chauffeur—he was one of Wolfshiem’s protégés—heard the shots—afterwards he could only say that he hadn’t thought anything much about them.", "alpha": "Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop."}, {"default": "“I’ll call you about noon.”", "length": "Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound.", "alpha": "Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder."}, {"default": "We walked slowly down the steps.", "length": "I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York.", "alpha": "Tom and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies."}, {"default": "“I suppose Daisy’ll call too.” He looked at me anxiously, as if he hoped I’d corroborate this.", "length": "“I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said: ‘All right, Katspaugh, don’t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.’ He shut it then and there.”", "alpha": "Tom and I looked at each other blankly."}, {"default": "“I suppose so.”", "length": "He raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable reproach, and, opening the door cautiously, went back into the other room.", "alpha": "Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod, and they trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage just as Gatsby, with hat and light overcoat in hand, came out the front door."}, {"default": "“Well, goodbye.”", "length": "His mouth opened a little, and he looked at Gatsby, and then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as someone he knew a long time ago.",

{"default": "We shook hands and I started away.", "length": "“That drugstore business was just small change,” continued Tom slowly, “but you’ve got something on now that Walter’s afraid to tell me about.”", "alpha": "Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while, trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front."}, {"default": "Just before I reached the hedge I remembered something and turned around.", "length": "Only the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes.", "alpha": "Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together."}, {"default": "“They’re a rotten crowd,” I shouted across the lawn.", "length": "But what gave it an air of breathless intensity, was that Daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him.", "alpha": "Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms."}, {"default": "“You’re worth the whole damn bunch put together.”", "length": "Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem, which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train.", "alpha": "Tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the train."}, {"default": "I’ve always been glad I said that.", "length": "She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and continued: “I looked outdoors for a minute, and it’s very romantic outdoors.", "alpha": "Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then his foot came down hard, and the coupé raced along through the night."}, {"default": "It was the only compliment I ever gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end.", "length": "The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty, with a solid, sticky bob of red hair, and a complexion powdered milky white.", "alpha": "Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body, and hurried into the room."}, {"default": "First he nodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding smile, as if we’d been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time.", "length": "People disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet away.", "alpha": "Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief."}, {"default": "His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of colour against the white steps, and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral home, three months before.", "length": "It was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees.", "alpha": "Tom laughed and turned to me."}, {"default": "The lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruption—and he had stood on those steps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye.", "length": "He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way.", "alpha": "Tom looked at him blankly."}, {"default": "I thanked him for his hospitality.", "length": "Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness—it stands out in my memory from Gatsby’s other parties that summer.", "alpha": "Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines."}, {"default": "We were always thanking him for that—I and the others.", "length": "Then he went into the jewellery store to buy a pearl necklace—or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons—rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.", "alpha": "Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but his voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamour on the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead."}, {"default": "“Goodbye,” I called.", "length": "“Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people.", "alpha": "Tom threw on both brakes impatiently, and we slid to an abrupt dusty stop under Wilson’s sign."}, {"default": "“I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.”", "length": "You see, I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad things that happened to me.” He hesitated.", "alpha": "Tom turned to Daisy sharply."}, {"default": "Up in the city, I tried for a while to list the quotations on an interminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair.", "length": "She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight.", "alpha": "Tom turned to me."}, {"default": "Just before noon the phone woke me, and I started up with sweat breaking out on my forehead.", "length": "At eleven o’clock a man in a raincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said that Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass.", "alpha": "Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby’s party."}, {"default": "It was Jordan Baker; she often called me up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other way.", "length": "At this point Miss Baker said: “Absolutely!” with such suddenness that I started—it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the room.", "alpha": "“Tom,” I inquired, “what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?”"}, {"default": "Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool, as if a divot from a green golf-links had come sailing in at the office window, but this morning it seemed harsh and dry.", "length": "I followed him over a low whitewashed railroad fence, and we walked back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg’s persistent stare.", "alpha": "Tomorrow!” Then she added irrelevantly: “You ought to see the baby.”"}, {"default": "“I’ve left Daisy’s house,” she said.", "length": "Sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission.", "alpha": "Tom’s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd."}, {"default": "“I’m at Hempstead, and I’m going down to Southampton this afternoon.”", "length": "Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was
