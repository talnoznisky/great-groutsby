# The Great Groutsby   
## What it's doing

1. Every instance of "Gatsby" has been replaced with "Groutsby"

2. Every sentence is pre-sorted by: 
    - its original position in the text, 
    - length, 
    - and alphabetically. 
    
    Each sequence can be reversed as well.

3. When the sentences are re-sorted, they are distributed to each paragraph according to the number of sentences it originally contained.

## Why it's doing these things
1. I saw "the great groutsby" graffitied among other grout puns in the grouting in the mens room of the music building at University of Washington.

2. To provide a quasi-ecommerce interface to meritorious literary products like FSG's overwrought sentences. 

3. To extend the discussion of literary structure and literary content by through newly interactive reading and publishing tools.

4. Other reasons I won't go into here. Please email me if you wanna chat about it.

- My colleague [Jay Kaiser](https://github.com/jayckaiser) for steering me toward the most appropriate NLP tools for the job.
- [BramVanoy](https://github.com/BramVanroy) for sharing their solution to similar sentence boundary detection challenges. I created a pipeline component out of the function you wrote. Thank you so much.

## P.S.
Neither the processing nor web presentation looks great right now. Please don't look too closely. Refactoring to come.
